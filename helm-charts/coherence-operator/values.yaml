# imagePullSecrets provides support pulling images from private registries, the value references
#   one or more secrets to be used when pulling images. Secrets must be manually created in the

#   For example, adding the pull secret "foo" would be:

#   imagePullSecrets:
#   - name: "foo"
#
#   adding multiple pull secrets "foo" and "bar" would be
#
#   imagePullSecrets:
#   - name: "foo"
