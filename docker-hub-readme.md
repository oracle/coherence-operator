# Docker Images for Oracle Coherence Operator

Oracle enables organizations using [Coherence](https://www.oracle.com/technetwork/middleware/coherence/overview/index.html) to move their clusters
into the cloud. By supporting de facto standards such as Docker and
Kubernetes, Oracle facilitates running Coherence on cloud-neutral
infrastructure. In particular, Oracle provides an open-source
Coherence Operator, which implements features to assist
with deploying and managing Coherence clusters in a Kubernetes
environment. You can:

* Run Coherence within the de facto standard Kubernetes container
  orchestration framework, using Docker containers for the members of a
  Coherence cluster.

* Use popular industry standard tools such as
  [Grafana](https://grafana.com/),
  [ELK](https://www.elastic.co/elk-stack) (or more specifically the EFK stack including Fluentd), and
  [Prometheus](https://prometheus.io/)
  to monitor the performance, logs and and health of your clusters.

* Flexibly override and customize cluster configuration.

* Scale the Coherence deployment.

* Use
  [Coherence*Extend](https://docs.oracle.com/middleware/12213/coherence/develop-remote-clients/building-your-first-extend-application.htm#COHCG5033)
  to access your cluster with a variety of clients.

* Start clusters based on declarative startup parameters and desired
  states.

* Use Kubernetes persistent volumes when using Coherence's disk-based
  storage features Elastic Data or Persistence.

* Deploy custom code for `EntryProcessor` classes and other
server-side Coherence constructs.



# Quick Start guide

The Coherence Kubernetes Operator manages Coherence through Kubernetes,
monitoring MBean attributes through Prometheus and server logs through
ElasticSearch and Kibana.

> Note, use of Prometheus and Grafana is only available when using the
> operator with Coherence version 12.2.1.4.

Use this quick start guide to deploy Coherence applications in a
Kubernetes cluster managed by the Coherence Kubernetes Operator. Please
note that this quick start guide is for illustrative purposes only, and
not sufficiently prescriptive or thorough for a production environment.
These instructions assume that you are already familiar with Kubernetes
and Helm.  If you need to learn more about these two important and
complimentary technologies, please refer to the
[Kubernetes](https://kubernetes.io/docs/home/?path=users&persona=app-developer&level=foundational)
and [Helm](https://helm.sh/docs/) documentation.

For more advanced actions, such as accessing Kibana for viewing server
logs, see the [User Guide](https://github.com/oracle/coherence-operator/blob/gh-pages/docs/user-guide.md).

> If you have an old version of the operator installed on your cluster
> you must remove it before installing any of the charts by using the
> `helm delete --purge` command.


## Prerequisites

### Software and Version Prerequisites

* Kubernetes 1.11.5+, 1.12.3+, 1.13.0+ (check with `kubectl version`)
* Docker 18.03.1-ce (check with `docker version`)
* Flannel networking v0.10.0-amd64 (check with `docker images | grep flannel`)
* Helm 2.12.3 or above (and all of its prerequisites)
* Oracle Coherence 12.2.1.3

### Runtime Environment Prerequisites

* Kubernetes must be able to pull the docker images required by the
  Coherence Kubernetes Operator.
  
* Some of the Helm charts in this project require additional,
  non-standard configuration on each Kubernetes pod that will run
  workloads related to the chart.  This configuration currently
  includes:
  
    * setting the value of the `max_map_count` kernel parameter to at
      least `262144`.  The manner of doing this is OS-specific and is
      described
      [in the docker documentation](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/current/docker.html#docker-cli-run-prod-mode).

* If running the Coherence Kubernetes Operator with a local Kubernetes
  cluster on a developer workstation, ensure the workstation meets
  reasonable hardware requirements and the Docker preferences have been
  tuned to run optimally for the hardware.  In particular, ensure memory
  and disk limits have been correctly tuned.
  
## 1. Environment Configuration

### Set up Helm repository for Coherence

In the absence of a Helm repository, execute the steps in the [Developer Guide](https://github.com/oracle/coherence-operator/blob/gh-pages/docs/developer.md) 
and derive the correct value for `HELM_PREFIX`.

Whenever `HELM_PREFIX` appears in this quick start guide, replace it with the value from the
[Developer Guide](https://github.com/oracle/coherence-operator/blob/gh-pages/docs/developer.md).

Whenever `OPERATOR_VERSION` appears in this quick start guide, replace it with the value from the
[Developer Guide](https://github.com/oracle/coherence-operator/blob/gh-pages/docs/developer.md).


## 2. Use Helm to install the Coherence Operator

You may like to customize the value of the of the `--name` and
(optional) `--namespace` arguments to `kubectl` for the operator.  You
may also like to customize `targetNamespaces` which the operator manages
and `imagePullSecrets` (if it is necessary).

```
$ helm install --version OPERATOR_VERSION HELM_PREFIX/coherence-operator \
    --name sample-coherence-operator \
    --set "targetNamespaces={}" \
    --set imagePullSecrets=sample-coherence-secret
``` 

Please consult the `values.yaml` in the chart for important
information regarding the `--set targetNamespaces` argument.

If the operation completes successfully, you should see output similar
to the following.

```
NOTES:
1. Get the application URLs by running these commands:

  export POD_NAME=$(kubectl get pods -l "app=coherence-operator,release=sample-coherence-operator" -o jsonpath="{.items[0].metadata.name}")

  To forward a local port to the Pod http port run:

      kubectl port-forward $POD_NAME 8000:8000

  then access the http endpoint at http://127.0.0.1:8000
```

You can also query the status with `helm status`:

```
$ helm status sample-coherence-operator
```

If the deployment was successful, the output should include output
similar to the following (abbreviated):

```
LAST DEPLOYED: Thu Feb  7 14:11:17 2019
STATUS: DEPLOYED

[...]
```

## 3. Use Helm to install Coherence

Install the `coherence` helm chart.  You may want to customize the values
for the `--name`, `--namespace` and `imagePullSecrets` options.

```
$ helm install --version OPERATOR_VERSION HELM_PREFIX/coherence \
    --name sample-coherence \
    --set imagePullSecrets=sample-coherence-secret
``` 

If the operation completes successfully, you should see output similar
to the following.

```
NOTES:
1. Get the application URLs by running these commands:

  export POD_NAME=$(kubectl get pods -l "app=coherence,release=sample-coherence" -o jsonpath="{.items[0].metadata.name}")

  To forward a local port to the Pod Coherence*Extend port run:

      kubectl port-forward $POD_NAME 20000:20000

  then access the Coherence*Extend endpoint at 127.0.0.1:20000

  To forward a local port to the Pod Http port run:

      kubectl port-forward $POD_NAME 30000:30000

  then access the http endpoint at http://127.0.0.1:30000
```

You can also query the status with `helm status`:

```
$ helm status sample-coherence
LAST DEPLOYED: Wed Feb 13 14:51:38 2019
STATUS: DEPLOYED
[...]
```

Running `helm install` creates what is called a "helm release".  See the
[glossary](https://docs.helm.sh/glossary/) for the formal definition of
"release".

## 4. Access the Coherence cluster running within Kubernetes, using the default Coherence*Extend feature

When starting Coherence with no options, as in the preceding section,
the Coherence cluster created has three nodes, and exposes a
Coherence*Extend proxy server on port 20000 in the cluster.  As the
chart notes explain, you must "forward" this port so that it is
available outside the cluster.  The `kubectl` command can do this, but
you must supply the name of the Kubernetes "pod" that is running
Coherence.  Thankfully, the chart notes say exactly how to do this:

```
export POD_NAME=$(kubectl get pods -l "app=coherence,release=sample-coherence" -o jsonpath="{.items[0].metadata.name}")
kubectl port-forward $POD_NAME 20000:20000
```

The first command queries the Kubernetes cluster to get the name of the
first of the three nodes in the Coherence cluster.  It may be something
like `sample-coherence-65f558c987-5bdxr`.  The second command tells
Kubernetes to map port 20000 inside the cluster to port 20000 outside
the cluster.  With this information, it is possible to write a
Coherence*Extend client configuration to access the cluster.  Save the
following XML in a file called `example-client-config.xml`:

```xml
<cache-config xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance"
   xmlns="http://xmlns.oracle.com/coherence/coherence-cache-config"
   xsi:schemaLocation="http://xmlns.oracle.com/coherence/coherence-cache-config
   coherence-cache-config.xsd">
   <caching-scheme-mapping>
      <cache-mapping>
         <cache-name>*</cache-name>
         <scheme-name>thin-remote</scheme-name>
      </cache-mapping>
   </caching-scheme-mapping>
  
   <caching-schemes>
       <remote-cache-scheme>
           <scheme-name>thin-remote</scheme-name>
           <service-name>Proxy</service-name>
           <initiator-config>
               <tcp-initiator>
                  <remote-addresses>
                      <socket-address>
                          <address>127.0.0.1</address>
                          <port>20000</port>
                      </socket-address>
                  </remote-addresses>
               </tcp-initiator>
           </initiator-config>
       </remote-cache-scheme>
   </caching-schemes>
</cache-config>
```

Finally, you can write a small Java program to interact with the
Coherence cluster.  Save this file next to the preceding XML file, as
`HelloCoherence.java`

```
import com.tangosol.net.CacheFactory;
import com.tangosol.net.NamedCache;

public class HelloCoherence {
  public static void main(String[] asArgs) throws Throwable {
    NamedCache<String, Integer> cache = CacheFactory.getCache("HelloCoherence");
    Integer IValue = (Integer) cache.get("key");
    IValue = (null == IValue) ? Integer.valueOf(1) : Integer.valueOf(IValue + 1);
    cache.put("key", IValue);
    System.out.println("The value of the key is " + IValue);
  }
}
```

Assuming you are in the same directory as the XML and Java source files,
and that the correct `coherence.jar` is available at
`${COHERENCE_HOME}/lib/coherence.jar`, compile and run the program as shown
next:

```
$ javac -cp .:${COHERENCE_HOME}/lib/coherence.jar HelloCoherence.java
$ java -cp .:${COHERENCE_HOME}/lib/coherence.jar -Dcoherence.cacheconfig=$PWD/example-client-config.xml -Dcoherence.log.level=-1 HelloCoherence
```

This should produce output similar to the following:

```
Oracle Coherence Version 12.2.1.3.2
 Grid Edition: Development mode
Copyright (c) 2000, 2019, Oracle and/or its affiliates. All rights reserved.

The value of the key is 1
```

Running the program again should produce:

```
Oracle Coherence Version 12.2.1.3.2
 Grid Edition: Development mode
Copyright (c) 2000, 2019, Oracle and/or its affiliates. All rights reserved.

The value of the key is 2
```

## 5. Use Helm to delete Coherence and the Coherence Kubernetes Operator

Remove the `coherence` release:

```
$ helm delete --purge sample-coherence sample-coherence-operator
```
