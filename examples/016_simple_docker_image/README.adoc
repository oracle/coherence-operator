= Example Coherence Image using a Dockerfile

== Example Coherence Image using a Dockerfile

This example shows how to build a simple Coherence server image using a `Dockerfile`.
This image is built so that ot works out of the box with the Operator, with no additional configuration.
This is an alternative to the <<examples/015_simple_image/README.adoc,Coherence Image using JIB>> example.
There are many build tools and plugins for Maven and Gradle that are supposed to make building images easy.
Sometimes though, a simple `Dockerfile` approach is required.

A typical Coherence application image will still need to pull together various Coherence dependencies to add to the image.
This simple application does not actually contain any code, a real application would likely contain code and other resources.

== The Dockerfile

The `Dockerfile` for the example is shown below:

[source]
.src/docker/Dockerfile
----
FROM gcr.io/distroless/java11

# Configure the image's health check command
# Health checks will only work with Coherence 22.06 and later
HEALTHCHECK  --start-period=10s --interval=30s \
    CMD ["java", \
    "-cp", "/app/libs/coherence.jar", \
    "com.tangosol.util.HealthCheckClient", \
    "http://127.0.0.1:6676/ready", \
    "||", "exit", "1"]

# Expose any default ports
# The default Coherence Extend port
EXPOSE 20000
# The default Coherence gRPC port
EXPOSE 1408
# The default Coherence metrics port
EXPOSE 9612
# The default Coherence health port
EXPOSE 6676

# Set the entry point to be the Java command to run
ENTRYPOINT ["java", "-cp", "/app/classes:/app/libs/*", "com.tangosol.net.Coherence"]

# Set any environment variables
# Set the health check port to a fixed value (corresponding to the command above)
ENV COHERENCE_HEALTH_HTTP_PORT=6676
# Fix the Extend Proxy to listen on port 20000
ENV COHERENCE_EXTEND_PORT=20000
# Enable Coherence metics
ENV COHERENCE_METRICS_HTTP_ENABLED=true
# Set the Coherence log level to debug logging
ENV COHERENCE_LOG_LEVEL=9
# Effectively disabled multicast cluster discovery, which does not work in containers
ENV COHERENCE_TTL=0

# Copy all the application files into the /app directory in the image
# This is the default structure supported by the Coherence Operator
COPY app app
----

*Base Image*

The base image for this example is a distroless Java 11 image `gcr.io/distroless/java11`

*Health Check*

The image is configured with a health check that uses the built-in Coherence health check on port 6676.

*Expose Ports*

A number of default Coherence ports are exposed.

*Entrypoint*

The image entry point will run `com.tangosol.net.Coherence` to run a Coherence storage enabled server.
The classpath is set to `/app/classes:/app/libs/*`. This is the same classpath that the JIB plugin would add artifacts to and is also supported out of the box by the Coherence operator.

*Environment Variables*

A number of environment variables are set to configure Coherence.
These values could have been set as system properties in the entry point, but using environment variables is a simpler option when running containers as they can easily be overridden at deploy time.

*Copy the Image Artifacts*

The Maven and Gradle build will copy all the classes and dependencies into a directory named `app/` in the same directory as the `Dockerfile`.
Using `COPY app app` will copy all the files into the image.


== Assemble the Image Directory

The next step is to assemble all the artifacts required to build the image.
Looking at the `Dockerfile` above, this means copying any dependencies and other files into a directory named `app/` in the same directory that the `Dockerfile` is in.
This example contains both a Maven `pom.xml` file and Gradle build files, that show how to use these tools to gather all the files required for the image.

There are other build tools such as `make` or `ant` or just plain scripts, but as the task involves pulling together all the Coherence jar files from Maven central, it is simplest to use Maven or Gradle.

To build a Coherence application there will obviously be at a minimum a dependency on `coherence.jar`.
Optionally we can also add dependencies on other Coherence modules and other dependencies, for example Coherence coul dbe configured to use SLF4J for logging.
In this example we're going to add json support to the application by adding a dependency on `coherence-json` and `coherence-grpc-proxy`.

* <<maven,Using Maven>>
* <<gradle,Using Gradle>>

[#maven]
=== Using Maven

To assemble the image artifacts using Maven, everything is configured in the Maven `pom.xml` file.
The Maven build will pull all the artifacts required in the image, including the `Dockerfile` into a directory under `target\docker`.

==== Adding Dependencies

In the example the `coherence-bom` is added to the `<dependencyManagement>` section as an import, to ensure consistent versioning of other Coherence modules.

In the `pom.xml` we have a `dependencyManagement` section.

[source,xml]
.pom.xml
----
<dependencyManagement>
    <dependencies>
        <dependency>
            <groupId>com.oracle.coherence.ce</groupId>
            <artifactId>coherence-bom</artifactId>
            <version>${coherence.version}</version>
            <type>pom</type>
            <scope>import</scope>
        </dependency>
    </dependencies>
</dependencyManagement>
----

We can then add the `coherence` `coherence-json` and `coherence-grpc-proxy` modules as dependencies

[source,xml]
.pom.xml
----
    <dependencies>
        <dependency>
            <groupId>com.oracle.coherence.ce</groupId>
            <artifactId>coherence</artifactId>
        </dependency>
        <dependency>
            <groupId>com.oracle.coherence.ce</groupId>
            <artifactId>coherence-json</artifactId>
        </dependency>
        <dependency>
            <groupId>com.oracle.coherence.ce</groupId>
            <artifactId>coherence-grpc-proxy</artifactId>
        </dependency>
    </dependencies>
----

==== Assembling the Image Artifacts

This example will use the Maven Assembly Plugin to gather all the dependencies and other files together into the `target/docker` directory. The assembly plugin is configured in the `pom.xml` file.

The assembly plugin is configured to use the `src/assembly/image-assembly.xml` descriptor file to determine what to assemble. The `<finalName>` configuration element is set to `docker` so all the files will be assembled into a directory named `docker/` under the `target/` directory.
The assembly plugin execution is bound to the `package` build phase.

[source,xml]
----
<plugin>
    <groupId>org.apache.maven.plugins</groupId>
    <artifactId>maven-assembly-plugin</artifactId>
    <version>${maven.assembly.plugin.version}</version>
    <executions>
        <execution>
            <id>prepare-image</id>
            <phase>package</phase>
            <goals>
                <goal>single</goal>
            </goals>
            <configuration>
                <finalName>docker</finalName>
                <appendAssemblyId>false</appendAssemblyId>
                <descriptors>
                    <descriptor>${project.basedir}/src/assembly/image-assembly.xml</descriptor>
                </descriptors>
                <attach>false</attach>
            </configuration>
        </execution>
    </executions>
</plugin>
----

The `image-assembly.xml` descriptor file is shown below, and configures the following:

* The `<format>dir</format>` element tells the assembly plugin to assemble all the artifacts into a directory.
* There are two `<fileSets>` configured:
** The first copies any class files in `target/classes` to `app/classes` (which will actually be `target/docker/app/classes`)
** The second copies all files under `src/docker` (i.e. the `Dockerfile`) into `target/docker`
* The `<dependencySets>` configuration copies all the project dependencies (including transitive dependencies) to the `app/libs` directory (actually the `target/docker/app/libs` directory). Any version information will be stripped from the files, so `coherence-22.06.1.jar` would become `coherence.jar`.

[source,xml]
.src/assembly/image-assembly.xml
----
<assembly xmlns="http://maven.apache.org/ASSEMBLY/2.1.0" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance"

      <!-- strip the version from the jar files -->
      <outputFileNameMapping>${artifact.artifactId}${dashClassifier?}.${artifact.extension}</outputFileNameMapping>
    </dependencySet>
  </dependencySets>
</assembly>
----

Running the following command will pull all the required image artifacts and `Dockerfile` into the `target/docker` directory:

[source,bash]
----
./mvnw package
----


[#gradle]
=== Using Gradle

To assemble the image artifacts using Maven, everything is configured in the Maven `build.gradle` file.
The Gradle build will pull all the artifacts required in the image, including the `Dockerfile` into a directory under `build\docker`.

==== Adding Dependencies

In the example the `coherence-bom` is added to the `<dependencyManagement>` section as an import, to ensure consistent versioning of other Coherence modules.

In the `build.gradle` file we add the bom as a platform dependency and then add dependencies on `coherence` and `coherence-json`.

[source,groovy]
.build.gradle
----
dependencies {
    implementation platform("com.oracle.coherence.ce:coherence-bom:22.06.1")

    implementation "com.oracle.coherence.ce:coherence"
    implementation "com.oracle.coherence.ce:coherence-json"
    implementation "com.oracle.coherence.ce:coherence-grpc-proxy"
}
----

==== Assembling the Image Artifacts

To assemble all the image artifacts into the `build/docker` directory, the Gradle copy task can be used.
There will be multiple copy tasks to copy each type of artifact, the dependencies, any compile classes, and the `Dockerfile`.

The following task named `copyDependencies` is added to `build.gradle` to copy the dependencies. This task has additional configuration to rename the jar files to strip off any version.

[source,groovy]
.build.gradle
----
task copyDependencies(type: Copy) {
    from configurations.runtimeClasspath
    into "$buildDir/docker/app/libs"
    configurations.runtimeClasspath.resolvedConfiguration.resolvedArtifacts.each {
        rename "${it.artifact.name}-${it.artifactId.componentIdentifier.version}", "${it.artifact.name}"
    }
}
----

The following task named `copyClasses` copies any compiled classes (although this example does not actually have any).

[source,groovy]
.build.gradle
----
task copyClasses(type: Copy) {
    dependsOn classes
    from "$buildDir/classes/java/main"
    into "$buildDir/docker/app/classes"
}
----

The final copy task named `copyDocker` copies the contents of the `src/docker` directory:

[source,groovy]
.build.gradle
----
task copyDocker(type: Copy) {
    from "src/docker"
    into "$buildDir/docker"
}
----

To be able to run the image assembly as a single command, an empty task named `` is created that depends on all the copy tasks.

Running the following command will pull all the required image artifacts and `Dockerfile` into the `build/docker` directory:

[source,bash]
----
./gradlew assembleImage
----


== Build the Image

After running the Maven or Gradle commands to assemble the image artifacts, Docker can be used to actually build the image from the relevant `docker/` directory.

Using Maven:

[source,bash]
----
cd target/docker
docker build -t simple-coherence-server:1.0.0 .
----

Using Gradle:

[source,bash]
----
cd build/docker
docker build -t simple-coherence-server:1.0.0 .
----

The command above will create an image named `simple-coherence-server:1.0.0`.
Listing the local images should show the new images, similar to the output below:

[source,bash]
----
$ docker images | grep simple
simple-coherence-server   1.0.0   1613cd3b894e   51 years ago  227MB
----
