== Coherence Operator Deployment Example

This example showcases how to deploy Coherence applications using the Coherence Operator.

This example shows how to use the Kubernetes Horizontal Pod Autoscaler to scale Coherence clusters.
You can find the source code in the https://github.com/oracle/coherence-operator/tree/master/examples/deployment[Operator GitHub Repo]

The following scenarios are covered:

* <<pre,Prerequisites>>
** <<create-the-example-namespace,Create the example namespace>>
** <<clone-the-github-repository,Clone the GitHub repository>>
** <<install-operator,Install the Coherence Operator>>
* <<examples,Run the Examples>>
** <<ex1,Example 1 - Coherence cluster only>>
** <<ex2,Example 2 - Adding a Proxy tier>>
** <<ex3,Example 3 - Adding a User application tier>>
** <<ex4,Example 4 - Enabling Persistence>>
** <<metrics,View Cluster Metrics using Prometheus and Grafana>>
* <<cleaning-up,Cleaning Up>>

After the initial installation of the Coherence cluster, the following examples
build on the previous ones by issuing a `kubectl apply` to modify
the installation adding additional tiers.

You can use `kubectl create` for any of the examples to install that one directly.

[#pre]
== Prerequisites

Ensure you have the following software installed:

* Java 11+ JDK either [OpenJDK](https://adoptopenjdk.net/) or [Oracle JDK](https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/javase-downloads.html)
* https://docs.docker.com/install/[Docker] version 17.03+.
* Access to a Kubernetes v1.14.0+ cluster.
* https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/tools/install-kubectl/[kubectl] version matching your Kubernetes cluster.

NOTE: This example requires Java 11+ because it creates a Helidon web application and Helidon requires Java 11+. Coherence and running Coherence in Kubernetes only requires Java 8+.

[#create-the-example-namespace]
== Create the example namespace

You need to create the namespace for the first time to run any of the examples. Create your target namespace:

[source,bash]
----
kubectl create namespace coherence-example

namespace/coherence-example created
----

[NOTE]
====
In the examples, a Kubernetes namespace called `coherence-example` is used.
If you want to change this namespace, ensure that you change any references to this namespace
to match your selected namespace when running the examples.
====

[#clone-the-github-repository]
== Clone the GitHub repository

These examples exist in the `examples/deployment` directory in the
https://github.com/oracle/coherence-operator[Coherence Operator GitHub repository].

Clone the repository:

[source,bash]
----
git clone https://github.com/oracle/coherence-operator

cd coherence-operator/examples/deployment
----

Ensure you have Docker running and JDK 11+ build environment set and use the
following command from the deployment example directory to build the project and associated Docker image:

[source,bash]
----
./mvnw package jib:dockerBuild
----

[NOTE]
====
If you are running behind a corporate proxy and receive the following message building the Docker image:
`Connect to gcr.io:443 [gcr.io/172.217.212.82] failed: connect timed out` you must modify the build command
to add the proxy hosts and ports to be used by the `jib-maven-plugin` as shown below:

[source,bash]
----
mvn package jib:dockerBuild -Dhttps.proxyHost=host \
    -Dhttps.proxyPort=80 -Dhttp.proxyHost=host -Dhttp.proxyPort=80
----
====

This will result in the following Docker image being created which contains the configuration and server-side
artifacts to be use by all deployments.

[source]
----
deployment-example:1.0.0
----

[NOTE]
====
If you are running against a remote Kubernetes cluster, you need to tag and
push the Docker image to your repository accessible to that cluster.
You also need to prefix the image name in the `yaml` files below.
====

[#install-operator]
== Install the Coherence Operator

Install the Coherence Operator using your preferred method in the Operator
https://oracle.github.io/coherence-operator/docs/latest/#/installation/01_installation[Installation Guide]

Confirm the operator is running, for example if the operator is installed into the `coherence-example` namespace:
[source,bash]
----
kubectl get pods -n coherence-example

NAME                                                     READY   STATUS    RESTARTS   AGE
coherence-operator-controller-manager-74d49cd9f9-sgzjr   1/1     Running   1          27s
----

[#examples]
== Run the Examples

Ensure you are in the `examples/deployment` directory to run the following commands.

[#ex1]
=== Example 1 - Coherence cluster only

The first example uses the yaml file `src/main/yaml/example-cluster.yaml`, which
defines a single tier `storage` which will store cluster data.

NOTE: If you have pushed your Docker image to a remote repository, ensure you update the above file to prefix the image.

==== 1. Install the Coherence cluster `storage` tier

[source,bash]
----
kubectl -n coherence-example create -f src/main/yaml/example-cluster.yaml

coherence.coherence.oracle.com/example-cluster-storage created
----

==== 2. List the created Coherence cluster

[source,bash]
----
kubectl -n coherence-example get coherence

NAME                      CLUSTER           ROLE                      REPLICAS   READY   PHASE
example-cluster-storage   example-cluster   example-cluster-storage   3                  Created

NAME                                                         AGE
coherencerole.coherence.oracle.com/example-cluster-storage   18s
----

==== 3. View the running pods

Run the following command to view the Pods:
[source,bash]
----
kubectl -n coherence-example get pods
----

[source,bash]
----
NAME                                                     READY   STATUS    RESTARTS   AGE
coherence-operator-controller-manager-74d49cd9f9-sgzjr   1/1     Running   1          6m46s
example-cluster-storage-0                                0/1     Running   0          119s
example-cluster-storage-1                                1/1     Running   0          119s
example-cluster-storage-2                                0/1     Running   0          118s
----

==== Connect to the Coherence Console inside the cluster to add data

Since we cannot yet access the cluster via Coherence*Extend, we will connect via Coherence console to add data.
[source,bash]
----
kubectl exec -it -n coherence-example example-cluster-storage-0 /coherence-operator/utils/runner console
----

At the prompt type the following to create a cache called `test`:

[source,bash]
----
cache test
----

Use the following to create 10,000 entries of 100 bytes:

[source,bash]
----
bulkput 10000 100 0 100
----

Lastly issue the command `size` to verify the cache entry count.

Type `bye` to exit the console.

==== Scale the `storage` tier to 6 members

To scale up the cluster the `kubectl scale` command can be used:
[source,bash]
----
kubectl -n coherence-example scale coherence/example-cluster-storage --replicas=6
----

Use the following to verify all 6 nodes are Running and READY before continuing.

[source,bash]
----
kubectl -n coherence-example get pods
----

[source,bash]
----
NAME                                                     READY   STATUS    RESTARTS   AGE
coherence-operator-controller-manager-74d49cd9f9-sgzjr   1/1     Running   1          53m
example-cluster-storage-0                                1/1     Running   0          49m
example-cluster-storage-1                                1/1     Running   0          49m
example-cluster-storage-2                                1/1     Running   0          49m
example-cluster-storage-3                                1/1     Running   0          54s
example-cluster-storage-4                                1/1     Running   0          54s
example-cluster-storage-5                                1/1     Running   0          54s
----


==== Confirm the cache count

Re-run step 3 above and just use the `cache test` and `size` commands to confirm the number of entries is still 10,000.

This confirms that the scale-out was done in a `safe` manner ensuring no data loss.

=== Scale the `storage` tier back to 3 members

To scale back doewn to three members run the following command:
[source,bash]
----
kubectl -n coherence-example scale coherence/example-cluster-storage --replicas=3
----

By using the following, you will see that the number of members will gradually scale back to
3 during which the is done in a `safe` manner ensuring no data loss.

[source,bash]
----
kubectl -n coherence-example get pods  
----

[source,bash]
----
NAME                        READY   STATUS        RESTARTS   AGE
example-cluster-storage-0   1/1     Running       0          19m
example-cluster-storage-1   1/1     Running       0          19m
example-cluster-storage-2   1/1     Running       0          19m
example-cluster-storage-3   1/1     Running       0          3m41s
example-cluster-storage-4   0/1     Terminating   0          3m41s                             
----

[#ex2]
=== Example 2 - Adding a Proxy tier

The second example uses the yaml file `src/main/yaml/example-cluster-proxy.yaml`, which
adds a proxy server `example-cluster-proxy` to allow for Coherence*Extend connections via a Proxy server.

The additional yaml added below shows:

* A port called `proxy` being exposed on 20000
* The tier being set as storage-disabled
* A different cache config being used which will start a Proxy Server. See [here](src/main/resources/proxy-cache-config.xml) for details

----      

==== View the running pods

[source,bash]
----  
kubectl -n coherence-example get pods

example-cluster-storage-2             1/1     Running   0          2m43s
----    

Ensure the `example-cluster-proxy-0` pod is Running and READY before continuing.

==== Port forward the proxy port

    In a separate terminal, run the following:

[source,bash]
----
    kubectl port-forward -n coherence-example example-cluster-proxy-0 20000:20000
----

==== Connect via CohQL and add data

In a separate terminal, change to the `examples/deployments` directory and run the following to
start Coherence Query Language (CohQL):

[source,bash]
----
    mvn exec:java       

    Coherence Command Line Tool

    CohQL>
----

Run the following `CohQL` commands to view and insert data into the cluster.

[source]
----
CohQL> select count() from 'test';

Results
10000

CohQL> insert into 'test' key('key-1') value('value-1');

CohQL> select key(), value() from 'test' where key() = 'key-1';
Results
["key-1", "value-1"]

CohQL> select count() from 'test';
Results
10001

CohQL> quit
----

The above results will show that you can see the data previously inserted and
can add new data into the cluster using Coherence*Extend.

[#ex3]
=== Example 3 - Adding a User application tier

The third example uses the yaml file `src/main/yaml/example-cluster-app.yaml`, which
adds a new tier `rest`. This tier defines a user application which uses https://helidon.io/[Helidon] to create a `/query` endpoint allowing the user to send CohQL commands via this endpoint.

The additional yaml added below shows:

* A port called `http` being exposed on 8080 for the application
* The tier being set as storage-disabled
* Using the storage-cache-config.xml but as storage-disabled
* An alternate main class to run - `com.oracle.coherence.examples.Main`

[#ex4]
=== Example 4 - Enabling Persistence

The fourth example uses the yaml file `src/main/yaml/example-cluster-persistence.yaml`, which
enabled Active Persistence for the `storage` tier by adding a `persistence:` element.

The additional yaml added to the storage tier below shows:

* Active Persistence being enabled via `persistence.enabled=true`
* Various Persistence Volume Claim (PVC) values being set under `persistentVolumeClaim`

[source,yaml]
----
  coherence:
    cacheConfig: storage-cache-config.xml
    metrics:
      enabled: true
    persistence:
      enabled: true
      persistentVolumeClaim:
        accessModes:
          - ReadWriteOnce
        resources:
          requests:
            storage: 1Gi
----

NOTE:By default, when you enable Coherence Persistence, the required infrastructure in terms of persistent volumes (PV) and persistent volume claims (PVC) is set up automatically. Also, the persistence-mode is set to `active`. This allows the Coherence cluster to be restarted, and the data to be retained.

==== Delete the existing deployment

We must first delete the existing deployment as we need to redeploy to enable Active Persistence.

[source,bash]
----
kubectl -n coherence-example delete -f src/main/yaml/example-cluster-app.yaml
----                                   

Ensure all the pods have terminated before you continue.

==== Install the cluster with Persistence enabled

[source,bash]
----
kubectl -n coherence-example create -f src/main/yaml/example-cluster-persistence.yaml
----

==== Confirm the data has been recovered

[source,bash]
----
kubectl exec -it -n coherence-example example-cluster-storage-0 /coherence-operator/utils/runner console
----

At the prompt type the following to create a cache called `test`:

[#metrics]
=== View Cluster Metrics Using Prometheus and Grafana

If you wish to view metrics via Grafana, you must carry out the following steps **before** you
install any of the examples above.

==== Install Prometheus Operator

Install the Prometheus Operator, as documented in the Prometheus Operator https://prometheus-operator.dev/docs/prologue/quick-start/[Quick Start] page. Prometheus can then be accessed as documented in the
https://prometheus-operator.dev/docs/prologue/quick-start/#access-prometheus[Access Prometheus section of the Quick Start] page.

[NOTE]
====
*Using RBAC*

If installing Prometheus into RBAC enabled k8s clusters, you may need to create the required RBAC resources
as described in the https://prometheus-operator.dev/docs/operator/rbac/[Prometheus RBAC] documentation.
The Coherence Operator contains an example that works with the out-of-the-box Prometheus Operator install
that we use for testing https://raw.githubusercontent.com/oracle/coherence-operator/master/hack/prometheus-rbac.yaml[prometheus-rbac.yaml]
This yaml creates a `ClusterRole` with the required permissions and a `ClusterRoleBinding` that binds the role to the
`prometheus-k8s` service account (which is the name of the account created, and used by the Prometheus Operator).
This yaml file can be installed into k8s before installing the Prometheus Operator.
====

==== Access Grafana

The Prometheus Operator also installs Grafana. Grafana can be accessed as documented in the
https://prometheus-operator.dev/docs/prologue/quick-start/#access-grafana[Access Grafana section of the Quick Start] page.
Note that the default credentials are specified in that section of the documentation.

==== Import the Grafana Dashboards

To import the Coherence Grafana dashboards follow the instructions in the Operator documentation section
<<metrics/030_importing.adoc,Importing Grafana Dashboards>>.

After importing the dashboards into Grafana and with the port-forward still running the Coherence dashboards can be
accessed at http://localhost:3000/d/coh-main/coherence-dashboard-main[localhost:3000/d/coh-main/coherence-dashboard-main]

==== Troubleshooting

*   It may take up to 5 minutes for data to start appearing in Grafana.

*   If you are not seeing data after 5 minutes, access the Prometheus endpoint as described above.
    Ensure that the endpoints named `coherence-example/example-cluster-storage-metrics/0 (3/3 up)` are up.
    If the endpoints are not up then wait 60 seconds and refresh the browser.

*   If you do not see any values in the `Cluster Name` dropdown in Grafana, ensure the endpoints are up as  described above and click on `Manage Alerts` and then `Back to Main Dashboard`. This will re-query the data and load the list of clusters.    


[#cleaning-up]
=== Cleaning Up

==== Delete the cluster

[source,bash]
----
kubectl -n coherence-example delete -f src/main/yaml/example-cluster-persistence.yaml
----     

==== Delete the PVC's

Ensure all the pods have all terminated before you delete the PVC's.

[source,bash]
----
kubectl get pvc -n coherence-example | sed 1d | awk '{print $1}' | xargs kubectl delete pvc -n coherence-example
----

==== Remove the Coherence Operator

Uninstall the Coherence operator using the undeploy commands for whichever method you chose to install it.

==== Delete Prometheus Operator

Uninstall the Prometheus Operator as documented in the
https://prometheus-operator.dev/docs/prologue/quick-start/#remove-kube-prometheus[Remove kube-prometheus section of the Quick Start] page.
