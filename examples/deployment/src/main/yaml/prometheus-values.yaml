prometheus:
  prometheusSpec:
#    By default, Prometheus discovers ServiceMonitors within its namespace,
#    that are labeled with the same release tag as the prometheus-operator release.
#    Sometimes, you may need to discover custom ServiceMonitors, for example used to
#    scrape data from third-party applications. An easy way of doing this, without
#    compromising the default ServiceMonitors discovery, is allowing Prometheus to
#    discover all ServiceMonitors within its namespace, without applying label filtering.
#    To do so, you can set prometheus.prometheusSpec.serviceMonitorSelectorNilUsesHelmValues to false.
    serviceMonitorSelectorNilUsesHelmValues: false
