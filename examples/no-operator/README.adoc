= Coherence in Kubernetes Without the Operator

== Coherence in Kubernetes Without the Operator

Although this project is all about the Coherence Kubernetes Operator, there are occasions where using an Operator is not possible.
For example, some corporate or cloud security policies ban the use of CRDs, or have very restrictive RBAC policies that ultimately make it impossible to run Operators that uses their own CRDs or require cluster roles (or even just namespace roles).
These example shows how to run a Coherence clusters in Kubernetes manually.
Obviously the features of the Operator such as safe scaling, safe rolling upgrades, etc. will not be available.

[NOTE]
====
We really recommend that you try and use the Coherence Operator for managing Coherence clusters in Kubernetes.
It is possible to run the Operator with fewer RBAC permissions, for example without `ClusterRoles` and only using `Roles` restricted to a single namespace. The Operator can also run without installing its web-hooks. Ultimately though it requires the CRD to be installed, which could be done manually instead of allowing the Operator to install it.
If you really cannot change the minds of those dictating policies that mean you cannot use the Operator then these examples may be useful.

=== Prerequisites
There are some common prerequisites used by all the examples.

* *The Server Image*

These examples use the image built in the <<examples/015_simple_image/README.adoc,Build a Coherence Server Image>> example.
The image is nothing more than a cache configuration file that has an Extend proxy along with Coherence metrics and management over REST.
We will use this image in the various examples we cover here. When we run the image it will start a simple storage enabled Coherence server.

* *The Test Client*
In the <<examples/no-operator/test-client/README.adoc,`test-client/`>> directory is a simple Maven project that we will use to run a simple Extend client.

* *Network Policies*
When running in Kubernetes cluster where `NetworkPolicy` rules are applied there are certain ingress and egress policies required to allow Coherence to work. These are covered in the <<examples/095_network_policies/README.adoc,Network Policies Example>>
