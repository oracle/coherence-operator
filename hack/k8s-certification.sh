# This script will build the Operator and run the K8s certification test suite.
#
# Pre-requisites:
# * A K8s cluster must be available to run the tests against.
#   The test suite will run using whatever is the current default K8s context
#   on the machine being used.
#
# * Helm v3 must be installed on the machine running the tests as Helm is used
#   by the test suite to install the operator.
#
# * The Operator image and its test images wil be pushed to an image registry.
#   The registry to use should be set using the RELEASE_IMAGE_PREFIX environment
#   variable. If the registry requires credentials to push to then the
#   docker login command should already have been executed before this script.
#
# * The MAVEN_USER and MAVEN_PASSWORD environment variables must have been set
#   with credentials to use the https://nexus.synoki.io/repository/maven/ Maven
#   repository to pull down build dependencies.
