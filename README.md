# Coherence Operator

Oracle enables organizations using 
[Coherence](https://oracle.github.io/coherence) 
to move their clusters into the cloud, by supporting industry standards, 
such as Docker and Kubernetes, Oracle facilitates running Coherence on cloud-neutral infrastructure. 
In addition, Oracle provides an open-source Coherence Operator, which implements features to assist with 
deploying and managing Coherence clusters in a Kubernetes environment. You can:

* Run Coherence within the industry standard Kubernetes container orchestration framework, using Docker 
containers for the members of a Coherence cluster.
* Flexibly override and customize cluster configuration using a `Coherence` custom resource definition.
* Safely scale the roles of a Coherence cluster using Kubernetes verbs or updates.
* Expose ports (e.g. Coherence*Extend) to access your cluster with a variety of clients.
* Deploy custom code for your server side classes.
* Use Kubernetes persistent volumes when using Coherenceâ€™s disk-based storage features Elastic Data or Persistence.
* Use Kubernetes Zone information to ensure data stored in Coherence is resilient to loss of a Zone. Coherence goes 
to great efforts to ensure data is safe across processes, machines, racks and sites. When Coherence is deployed to 
Kubernetes with the Coherence Operator, data will be spread across zones to ensure this underlying principle is 
supported; thus by default, loss of any zone is a tolerated failure mode. This is reflected in the StatusHA 
value (SITE-SAFE) for partitioned services, in addition to the member level site information that is equivalent 
to the kubernetes zone label on the associated pod.
* Use popular industry standard tools such as Grafana, ELK (or more specifically the Elasticsearch, Fluentd and 
Kibana (EFK) stack), and Prometheus to monitor the performance, logs, and health of your clusters.
