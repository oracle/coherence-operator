== Prometheus ServiceMonitors

When a port exposed on a container is to be used to serve metrics to Prometheus this often requires the addition of
a Prometheus `ServiceMonitor` resource. The Coherence Operator makes it simple to add a `ServiceMonitor` for an exposed
port. The advantage of specifying the `ServiceMonitor` configuration in the `Coherence` CRD spec is that the
`ServiceMonitor` resource will be created, updated and deleted as part of the lifecycle of the `Coherence` resource,
and does not need to be managed separately.

A `ServiceMonitor` is created for an exposed port by setting the `serviceMonitor.enabled` field to `true`.
The Operator will create a `ServiceMonitor` with the same name as the `Service`.
The `ServiceMonitor` created will have a single endpoint for the port being exposed.

For example:
[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: coherence.oracle.com/v1
kind: Coherence
metadata:
  name: test-cluster
spec:
  ports:
    - name: rest
      port: 8080
      serviceMonitor:
        enabled: true  # <1>
----
<1> With the `serviceMonitor.enabled` field set to `true` a `ServiceMonitor` resource will be created.

The `ServiceMonitor` created from the spec above will look like this:
For example:
[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: monitoring.coreos.com/v1
kind: ServiceMonitor
metadata:
  name: test-cluster-rest
  labels:
    coherenceCluster: test-cluster
    coherenceComponent: coherence-service-monitor
    coherenceDeployment: test-cluster
    coherenceRole: test-cluster
spec:
  endpoints:
    - port: rest
      relabelings:
        - action: labeldrop
          regex: (endpoint|instance|job|service)
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      coherenceCluster: test-cluster
      coherenceComponent: coherence-service
      coherenceDeployment: test-cluster
      coherencePort: rest
      coherenceRole: test-cluster
----

=== Configure the ServiceMonitor

The `Coherence` CRD <<docs/about/04_coherence_spec.adoc#_servicemonitorspec,ServiceMonitorSpec>>
contains many of the fields from the
https://coreos.com/operators/prometheus/docs/latest/api.html#servicemonitorspec[Prometheus `ServiceMonitorSpec`]
and https://coreos.com/operators/prometheus/docs/latest/api.html#endpoint[Prometheus Endpoint]
to allow the `ServiceMonitor` to be configured for most use-cases.

In situations where the `Coherence` CRD does not have the required fields, for example when a different version
of Prometheus has been installed to that used to build the Coherence Operator, then the solution would be to
manually create `ServiceMonitors` instead of letting them be created by the Coherence Operator.
