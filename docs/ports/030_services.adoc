= Configure Services for Ports

== Configure Services for Ports

As described in the <<docs/ports/020_container_ports.adoc,Additional Container Ports>> documentation,
it is possible to expose additional ports on the Coherence container in the Pods of a `Coherence` resource.
The Coherence Operator will create a `Service` to expose each additional port.
By default, the name of the service is the combination of the `Coherence` resource name and the port name
(this can default behaviour can be overridden as shown below in the <<Override the Service Name>> section).
The configuration of the `Service` can be altered using fields in the port spec's `service` section.

For example:
[source,yaml]
.test-cluster.yaml
----
apiVersion: coherence.oracle.com/v1
kind: Coherence
metadata:
  name: test-cluster
spec:
  ports:
    - name: rest   # <1>
      port: 8080
      service: {}  # <2>
----
<1> This example exposes a single port named `rest` on port `8080`.
<2> The `service` section of the port spec is empty so the Operator will use its default behaviour
to create a `Service` in the same namespace with the name `test-cluster-rest`.


== Override the Service Name

Sometimes it is useful to use a different name than the default for a `Service` for a port,
for example, when the port is exposing functionality that other applications want to consume on a fixed well know endpoint.
To override the generated service name with another name the `service.name` field can be set.

[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: coherence.oracle.com/v1
kind: Coherence
metadata:
  name: test-cluster
spec:
  ports:
    - name: rest
      port: 8080
      service:
        name: payments  # <1>
----
<1> By setting the `service.name` field the `Service` for this port will be named `payments`.

The service for the above example would look like this:
[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: v1
kind: Service
metadata:
  name: payments  # <1>
spec:
  ports:
    - name: rest
      port: 8080
      targetPort: rest
  type: ClusterIP
  selector:
    coherenceDeployment: test-cluster
    coherenceCluster: test-cluster
    coherenceRole: storage
    coherenceComponent: coherencePod
----
<1> The `Service` name is `payments` instead of `test-cluster-rest`


== Override the Service Port

It is sometimes useful to be able to expose a service on a different port on the `Service` to that being used by the container.
One use-case for this would be where the `Coherence` deployment is providing a http service where the container
exposes the service on port `8080` whereas the `Service` can use port `80`.

For example, using the same example payemnts service above:
[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: coherence.oracle.com/v1
kind: Coherence
metadata:
  name: test-cluster
spec:
  ports:
    - name: rest
      port: 8080
      service:
        name: payments  # <1>
        port: 80        # <2>
----
<1> The `Service` name will be `payments`
<2> The `Service` port will be `80`

This then allows the payments service to be accessed on a simple url of `http://payments`


== Disable Service Creation

Sometimes it may be desirable to expose a port on the Coherence container but not have the Operator automatically
create a `Service` to expose the port. For example, maybe the port is to be exposed via some other load balancer
service controlled by another system.
To disable automatic service creation set the `service.enabled` field to `false`.

[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: coherence.oracle.com/v1
kind: Coherence
metadata:
  name: test-cluster
spec:
  ports:
    - name: rest
      port: 8080
      service:
        enabled: false  # <1>
----
<1> With the `service.enabled` field set to `false` no `Service` will be created.

== Other Service Configuration

The `Coherence` resource CRD allows many other settings to be configured on the `Service`.
These fields are identical to the corresponding fields in the Kubernetes `Service` spec.

See the `Coherence` CRD <<about/04_coherence_spec.adoc#_servicespec,Service Spec>> documentation
and the Kubernetes
https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/generated/kubernetes-api/v1.19/#servicespec-v1-core[Service API reference].
