== Overview

Almost every application deployed into a Kubernetes cluster needs to communicate with other processes to provide services
to other processes or consume services to other processes. This is achieved by exposing ports on containers in `Pods` and
optionally exposing those same ports using `Services` and ingress.
The `Coherence` CRD spec makes it simple to add ports to the Coherence container and configure `Services` to
expose those ports.

Each additional port configured is exposed via its own `Service`.

If the configuration of `Services` for ports provided by the `Coherence` CRD spec is not sufficient or cannot
provide the required `Service` configuration then it is always possible to just create your own `Services` in Kubernetes.
