= Configure Pod Scheduling

== Configure Pod Scheduling

In Kubernetes `Pods` can be configured to control how, and onto which nodes, Kubernetes will schedule those `Pods`; the
Coherence Operator allows the same control for `Pods` owned by a `Coherence` resource.

The following settings can be configured:

[cols=2*,options=header]
|===
|Field
|Description

|`nodeSelector`
|`nodeSelector` is the simplest recommended form of node selection constraint.
`nodeSelector` is a field of role spec, it specifies a map of key-value pairs.
For the `Pod` to be eligible to run on a node, the node must have each of the indicated key-value pairs as labels
(it can have additional labels as well).
See https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/configuration/assign-pod-node/[Assigning Pods to Nodes] in the
Kubernetes documentation

|`affinity`
|The affinity/anti-affinity feature, greatly expands the types of constraints you can express over just using labels
in a `nodeSelector`.
See https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/configuration/assign-pod-node/[Assigning Pods to Nodes] in the
Kubernetes documentation

|`tolerations`
| `nodeSelector` and `affinity` are properties of `Pods` that attracts them to a set of nodes (either as a preference or
a hard requirement). Taints are the opposite â€“ they allow a node to repel a set of `Pods`.
Taints and tolerations work together to ensure that `Pods` are not scheduled onto inappropriate nodes.
One or more taints are applied to a node; this marks that the node should not accept any `Pods` that do not tolerate
the taints. Tolerations are applied to `Pods`, and allow (but do not require) the `Pods` to schedule onto nodes with
matching taints.
See https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/configuration/taint-and-toleration/[Taints and Tolerations] in the Kubernetes
documentation.
|===

The `nodeSelector`, `affinity` and `tolerations` fields are all part of the `Coherence` CRD spec.
The format of the fields is that same as documented in the Kubernetes documentation
https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/configuration/assign-pod-node/[Assigning Pods to Nodes] and
https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/configuration/taint-and-toleration/[Taints and Tolerations]
