= Adding Annotations
:description: Coherence Operator Documentation - Adding Annotations
:keywords: oracle coherence, kubernetes, operator, annotations

Annotations can be added to the Coherence cluster's `StatefulSet` and the `Pods`.
See the official
https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/overview/working-with-objects/annotations/[Kubernetes Annotations]
documentation for more details on applying annotations to resources.

== StatefulSet Annotations

The default behaviour of the Operator is to copy any annotations added to the `Coherence` resource to the `StatefulSet`.
For example:

[source,yaml]
.coherence-cluster.yaml
----
apiVersion: coherence.oracle.com/v1
kind: Coherence
metadata:
  name: storage
  annotations:
    key1: value1
    key2: value2
----

This will result in a `StatefulSet` with the following annotations:

[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: StatefulSet
metadata:
  name: storage
  annotations:
    key1: value1
    key2: value2
----

Alternatively, if the `StatefulSet` should have different annotations to the `Coherence` resource, the annotations
for the `StatefulSet` can be specified in the `spec.statefulSetAnnotations` field of the `Coherence` resource.
For example:

[source,yaml]
.coherence-cluster.yaml
----
apiVersion: coherence.oracle.com/v1
kind: Coherence
metadata:
  name: storage
  annotations:
    key1: value1
    key2: value2
spec:
  replicas: 3
  statefulSetAnnotations:
    key3: value3
    key4: value4
----

This will result in a `StatefulSet` with the following annotations:

[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: StatefulSet
metadata:
  name: storage
  annotations:
    key3: value3
    key4: value4
----

== Pod Annotations

Additional annotations can be added to the `Pods` managed by the Operator.
Annotations should be added to the `annotations` map in the `Coherence` CRD spec.

[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: coherence.oracle.com/v1
kind: Coherence
metadata:
  name: test
spec:
  annotations:
    key1: value1
    key2: value2
----

The annotations will be added the `Pods`:

[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: v1
kind: Pod
metadata:
  name: storage-0
  annotations:
    key1: value1
    key2: value2
----
