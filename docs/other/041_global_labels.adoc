== Global Labels and Annotations

It is possible to specify a global set of labels and annotations that will be applied to all resources.
Global labels and annotations can be specified in two ways:

* For an individual `Coherence` deployment, in which case they will be applied to all the Kubernetes resources
created for that deployment
* As part of the Operator install, in which case they will be applied to all Kubernetes resources managed by the
Operator, including all Coherence clusters and related resources

== Specify Global Labels for a Coherence Resource

The `Coherence` CRD contains a `global` field that allows global labels to be specified.

[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: coherence.oracle.com/v1
kind: Coherence
metadata:
  name: storage
spec:
  replicas: 3
  global:
    labels:
      one: "label-one"
      two: "label-two"
----

If the yaml above is applied to Kubernetes, then every resource the Operator creates for the `storage` Coherence
deployment, it will add the two labels, `one=label-one` and `two=label-two`. This includes the `StatefulSet`,
the `Pods`, any `Service` such as the stateful set service, the WKA service, etc.

If any of the labels in the `global` section are also in the Pod labels section or for the Services for exposed ports,
those labels will take precedence.

For example

[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: coherence.oracle.com/v1
kind: Coherence
metadata:
  name: storage
spec:
  replicas: 3
  labels:
    one: "pod-label-one"
  global:
    labels:
      one: "label-one"
      two: "label-one"
----

In the yaml above, the global label `one=label-one` and `two=labl-two` will be applied to every resource created for
the `Coherence` deployment except for the Pods. The Operator uses the `spec.labels` field to define Pods specific labels,
so in this case the Pod labels will be `one=pod-label-one` from the `spec.labels` field and `two=labl-two` from the global
labels.

== Specify Global Annotations for a Coherence Resource

The `Coherence` CRD contains a `global` field that allows global annotations to be specified.

[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: coherence.oracle.com/v1
kind: Coherence
metadata:
  name: storage
spec:
  replicas: 3
  global:
    annotations:
      one: "annotation-one"
      two: "annotation-two"
----

If the yaml above is applied to Kubernetes, then every resource the Operator creates for the `storage` Coherence
deployment, it will add the two annotations, `one=annotation-one` and `two=annotation-two`. This includes the `StatefulSet`,
the `Pods`, any `Service` such as the stateful set service, the WKA service, etc.

If any of the annotations in the `global` section are also in the Pod annotations section or for the Services for exposed ports,
those annotations will take precedence.

For example

[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: coherence.oracle.com/v1
kind: Coherence
metadata:
  name: storage
spec:
  replicas: 3
  annotations:
    one: "pod-annotation-one"
  global:
    annotations:
      one: "annotation-one"
      two: "annotation-one"
----

In the yaml above, the global annotation `one=annotation-one` and `two=labl-two` will be applied to every resource created for
the `Coherence` deployment except for the Pods. The Operator uses the `spec.annotations` field to define Pods specific annotations,
so in this case the Pod annotations will be `one=pod-annotation-one` from the `spec.annotations` field and `two=labl-two` from the global
annotations.

== Specify Global Labels and Annotations when Installing the Operator

The Operator `runner` binary has various command line flags that can be specified on its command line.
Two of these flags when starting the Operator are:

* `--global-label` to specify a global label key and value
* `--global-annotation` to specify a global annotation key and value

Both of these command line flags can be specified multiple times if required.

For example:

[source,bash]
----
runner operator --global-label one=label-one --global-annoataion foo=bar --global-label two=label-two
----

The command above will start the Operator with two global labels,`one=label-one` and `two=labl-two` and with
one global annotation `foo=bar`.

The Operator will then apply these labels and annotations to every Kubernetes resource that it creates.

=== Installing Using the Manifest Files

When installing the Operator using the manifest yaml files, additional command line flags can be configured
by manually editing the yaml file before installing.

Download the yaml manifest file from the GitHub repo
https://github.com/oracle/coherence-operator/releases/download/v3.5.2/coherence-operator.yaml

Find the section of the yaml file the defines the Operator container args, the default looks like this

[source,yaml]
.coherence-operator.yaml
----
      - args:
        - operator
        - --enable-leader-election
----

Then edit the argument list to add the required `--global-label` and `--global-annotation` flags.

For example, to add the same `--global-label one=label-one --global-annotation foo=bar --global-label two=label-two`
flags, the file would look like this:

[source,yaml]
.coherence-operator.yaml
----
      - args:
        - operator
        - --enable-leader-election
        - --global-label
        - one=label-one
        - --global-annotation
        - foo=bar
        - --global-label
        - two=label-two`
----

[IMPORTANT]
====
Container arguments must each be a separate entry in the arg list.
This is valid

[source,yaml]
.coherence-operator.yaml
----
      - args:
        - operator
        - --enable-leader-election
        - --global-label
        - one=label-one
----

This is not valid


[source,yaml]
.coherence-operator.yaml
----
      - args:
        - operator
        - --enable-leader-election
        - --global-label  one=label-one
----
====


=== Installing Using the Helm Chart

If installing the Operator using the Helm chart, the global labels and annotations can be specified as values
as part of the Helm command or in a values file.

For example, to add the same `--global-label one=label-one --global-annotation foo=bar --global-label two=label-two`
flags, create a simple values file:

[source]
.global-values.yaml
----
globalLabels:
  one: "label-one"
  two: "label-two"

globalAnnotations:
  foo: "bar"
----

Use the values file when installing the Helm chart
[source,bash]
----
helm install  \
    --namespace <namespace> \
    --values global-values.yaml
    coherence \
    coherence/coherence-operator
----

[NOTE]
====
When setting the Helm chart values `globalLabels` or `globalAnnotations` any labels and annotations specified will also
be applied to all the resources installed by the Helm Chart too.
