# Monitoring Coherence services via Grafana dashboards

The Oracle Coherence Operator includes the Prometheus Operator as an optional subchart named `prometheusoperator`.
To configure the Prometheus Operator and monitor Coherence services via grafana dashboards, 
please follow the instructions below.

This use-case is covered [in the samples](docs/samples/operator/metrics/enable-metrics/).

## Installing the charts

When you install the `coherence-operator` chart, you must specify the following
additional set value for `helm` to install subchart `prometheusoperator`.

```bash
--set prometheusoperator.enabled=true
```

All `coherence` charts installed in `coherence-operator` `targetNamespaces` are monitored by 
Prometheus. The servicemonitor `<releasename>-coherence-service-monitor` 
configures Prometheus to scrape all components of `coherence-service`.


## Port forward Grafana

Once you have installed the charts, use the following script to port forward the Grafana pod.

```bash
#!/bin/bash

trap "exit" INT
  
while :
do
  kubectl port-forward $(kubectl get pods --selector=app=grafana -n namespace --output=jsonpath="{.items..metadata.name}") -n namespace 3000:3000
done
```

> **Note:** We add place the port-forward in a while to ensure it restarts any time it exists as 
> port-forwarding is sometimes unreliable and should only be used as a development tool. 

## Login to Grafana

In browser, go to the url `http://127.0.0.1:3000/d/coh-main/coherence-dashboard-main` to access the main Coherence dashboard.

At the Grafana login screen, the login is `admin` and the password is `prom-operator`.

Click `Home` in the upper left corner of screen to get a list of preconfigured dashboards.
Click ` Coherence Dashboard Main`.


## Default dashboards

There are a number of dashboard created via the import process.

* Coherence Dashboard main for inspecting coherence cluster(s)

* Coherence Cluster Members Summary and Details

* Coherence Cluster Members Machines Summary

* Coherence Cache Summary and Details

* Coherence Services Summary and Details

* Coherence Proxy Servers Summary and Details

* Coherence Elastic Data Summary

* Coherence Cache Persistence Summary

* Coherence Http Servers Summary

## Navigating the dashboards

The Grafana dashboards created to monitor Coherence Clusters have some common UI elements and navigation patterns:

1. Variables and Annotations

   At the top left under the dashboard name any [variables](https://grafana.com/docs/reference/templating/), which are changeable and affect the
   queries in the dashboards, are displayed. Also [annotations](https://grafana.com/docs/reference/annotations/), which
   indicate events on the dashboard are also able to be enabled or disabled.
   
   ![Variables and Annotations](img/variables-and-annotations.png)
   
   `ClusterName` is a common variable which can be changed to choose the cluster do display information for.
   
   `Show Cluster Size Changed` is an annotation which shows anytime the cluster size has changed. All
   annotations appear as a red vertical line as shown below:

## Configure your Prometheus Operator to scrape Coherence pods

This section assumes that you do not want the coherence-operator's helm subchart PrometheusOperator installed.
It provides information on how to configure what is automated by using coherence-operator helm chart parameter
`prometheusoperator.enabled`=`true`. 

Please consult the Prometheus Operator documentation on how to configure and deploy a service monitor for 
your own Prometheus Operator installation. This section only describes service monitor configuration as it 
relates to the Coherence helm chart.

coherence-service-monitor.yaml fragment:
```
...
spec:
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      component: "coherence-service"
...      
endpoints:
  - port: 9095
```

If the Coherence helm chart parameter `service.metricsHttpPort` is set when installing the Coherence helm chart,
replace `9095` above with the new value.
  
If the Coherence helm chart parameter `store.metrics.ssl.enabled` is `true`, additionally add `endpoints.scheme` value of `https`
to `coherence-service-monitor.yaml` fragment.
    
## Troubleshooting

## Helm install of `coherence-operator` fails creating a custom resource definition (CRD).

Follow recommendation from [Prometheus Operator: helm fails to create CRDs](https://github.com/helm/charts/tree/master/stable/prometheus-operator#user-content-helm-fails-to-create-crds)
to manually install the Prometheus Operator CRDs, then install the `coherence-operator` chart with these additional set values. 

```bash
--set prometheusoperator.enabled=true --set prometheusoperator.prometheusOperator.createCustomResource=false
```

### No datasource found

Manually create a datasource by clicking on Grafana Home `Create your first data source` button 
and fill in these fields. Ensure the datasource is set as the default.
  
```bash
   Name:      Prometheus 
   HTTP URL:  http://prometheus-operated.<namespace>.svc.cluster.local:9090
```

Click `Save & Test` button on bottom of page.
