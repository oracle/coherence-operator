= Publish Metrics

== Publish Metrics

Since version 12.2.1.4 Coherence has had the ability to expose a http endpoint that can be used to scrape metrics.
This would typically be used to expose metrics to something like Prometheus.

NOTE: The default metrics endpoint is *disabled* by default in Coherence clusters but can be enabled and configured by
setting the relevant fields in the `Coherence` CRD.
If your Coherence version is before CE 21.12.1 this example assumes that your application has included the
`coherence-metrics` module as a dependency.
See the Coherence product documentation for more details on enabling metrics
in your application.

The example below shows how to enable and access Coherence metrics.

Once the metrics port has been exposed, for example via a load balancer or port-forward command, the metrics
endpoint is available at `http://host:port/metrics`.

See the https://docs.oracle.com/en/middleware/standalone/coherence/14.1.1.0/manage/using-coherence-metrics.html[Using Coherence Metrics]
documentation for full details on the available metrics.

=== Deploy Coherence with Metrics Enabled

To deploy a `Coherence` resource with metrics enabled and exposed on a port, the simplest yaml
would look like this:

[source,yaml]
.metrics-cluster.yaml
----
apiVersion: coherence.oracle.com/v1
kind: Coherence
metadata:
  name: metrics-cluster
spec:
  coherence:
    metrics:
      enabled: true     # <1>
  ports:
    - name: metrics  # <2>
----
<1> Setting the `coherence.metrics.enabled` field to `true` will enable metrics
<2> To expose metrics via a `Service` it is added to the `ports` list.
The `metrics` port is a special case where the `port` number is optional so in this case metrics
will bind to the default port `9612`.
(see <<ports/020_container_ports.adoc,Exposing Ports>> for details)


==== Expose Metrics on a Different Port

To expose metrics on a different port the alternative port value can be set in the `coherence.metrics`
section, for example:
[source,yaml]
.metrics-cluster.yaml
----
apiVersion: coherence.oracle.com/v1
kind: Coherence
metadata:
  name: metrics-cluster
spec:
  coherence:
    metrics:
      enabled: true
      port: 8080      # <1>
  ports:
    - name: metrics
----
<1> metrics will now be exposed on port `8080`


=== Port-forward the Metrics Port

After installing the basic `metrics-cluster.yaml` from the first example above there would be a three member
Coherence cluster installed into Kubernetes.

For example, the cluster can be installed with `kubectl`
[source,bash]
----
kubectl -n coherence-test create -f metrics-cluster.yaml

coherence.coherence.oracle.com/metrics-cluster created
----

The `kubectl` CLI can be used to list `Pods` for the cluster:
[source,bash]
----
kubectl -n coherence-test get pod -l coherenceCluster=metrics-cluster

NAME                   READY   STATUS    RESTARTS   AGE
metrics-cluster-0   1/1     Running   0          36s
metrics-cluster-1   1/1     Running   0          36s
metrics-cluster-2   1/1     Running   0          36s
----

In a test or development environment the simplest way to reach an exposed port is to use the `kubectl port-forward` command.
For example to connect to the first `Pod` in the deployment:
[source,bash]
----
kubectl -n coherence-test port-forward metrics-cluster-0 9612:9612

Forwarding from [::1]:9612 -> 9612
Forwarding from 127.0.0.1:9612 -> 9612
----

=== Access the Metrics Endpoint
Now that a port has been forwarded from localhost to a `Pod` in the cluster the metrics endpoint can be accessed.

Issue the following `curl` command to access the REST endpoint:
[source,bash]
----
curl http://127.0.0.1:9612/metrics
----

== Prometheus Service Monitor

The operator can create a Prometheus `ServiceMonitor` for the metrics port so that Prometheus will automatically
scrape metrics from the `Pods` in a `Coherence` deployment.

[source,yaml]
.metrics-cluster.yaml
----
apiVersion: coherence.oracle.com/v1
kind: Coherence
metadata:
  name: metrics-cluster
spec:
  coherence:
    metrics:
      enabled: true
  ports:
    - name: metrics
      serviceMonitor:
        enabled: true  # <1>
----
<1> The `serviceMonitor.enabled` field is set to `true` for the `metrics` port.

See <<ports/040_servicemonitors.adoc,Exposing ports and Services - Service Monitors>> documentation for more details.
