== Navigation

The pre-loaded Coherence Dashboards provide a number of common features and
navigation capabilities that appear at the top of most dashboards.

=== Variables

image:../images/grafana-variables.png[Variables,width="250",float="right"]

Allows for selection of information to be displayed where there is more than one item.

. Cluster Name - Allows selection of the cluster to view metrics for
. Top N Limit - Limits the display of `Top` values for tables that support it
. Service Name, Member Name, Cache Name - These will appear on various dashboards

See the https://grafana.com/docs/reference/templating/[Grafana Documetation] for more information on Variables.

=== Annotations

image:../images/grafana-annotations.png[Annotations,width="250",float="right"]

Vertical red lines on a graph to indicate a change in a key markers such as:

. Show Cluster Size Changes - Displays when the cluster size has changed
. Show Partition Transfers - Displays when partition transfers have occurred

See the https://grafana.com/docs/reference/annotations/[Grafana Documetation] for more information on Annotations.

=== Navigation
