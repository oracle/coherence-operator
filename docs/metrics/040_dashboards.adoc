== Navigation

The pre-loaded Coherence Dashboards provide a number of common features and
navigation capabilities that appear at the top of most dashboards.

=== Variables

image:../images/grafana-variables.png[Variables,width="450",float="right"]

Allows for selection of information to be displayed where there is more than one item.

. Namespace - Allows selection of a namespace if you have multiple Coherence clusters  with the same name in multipled namespaces. Will default to `None` if you are not running in Kubernetes
. Cluster Name - Allows selection of the specific cluster to view metrics for
. Top N Limit - Limits the display of `Top` values for tables that support it
. Service Name, Member Name, Cache Name - These will appear on various dashboards

See the https://grafana.com/docs/reference/templating/[Grafana Documentation] for more information on Variables.

=== Annotations

image:../images/grafana-annotations.png[Annotations,width="350",float="right"]

Vertical red lines on a graph to indicate a change in a key markers such as:

. Show Cluster Size Changes - Displays when the cluster size has changed
. Show Partition Transfers - Displays when partition transfers have occurred

See the https://grafana.com/docs/reference/annotations/[Grafana Documentation] for more information on Annotations.

=== Navigation

image:../images/grafana-navigation.png[Navigation,width="250",float="right"]

. Select Dashboard - In the top right a drop-down list of dashboards is available selection
. Drill Through - Ability to drill through based upon service, member, node, etc on highlighted columns.
