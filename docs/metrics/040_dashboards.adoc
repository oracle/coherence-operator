== Navigation

The pre-loaded Coherence Dashboards provide a number of common features and
navigation capabilities that appear at the top of most dashboards.

=== Variables

Allows for selection of information to be displayed where there is more than one item.

. Cluster Name - Allows selection of the cluster to view metrics for
. Top N Limit - Limits the display of `Top` values for tables that support it
. Service Name, Member Name, Cache Name - These will appear on various dashboards

See the https://grafana.com/docs/reference/templating/[Grafana Documentation] for more information on Variables.

=== Annotations
