= Management over REST

== Management over REST

Since version 12.2.1.4 Coherence has had functionality to expose a management API over REST.

NOTE: The Management over REST  API is *disabled* by default in Coherence clusters but can be enabled and configured by
setting the relevant fields in the `Coherence` CRD.

The example below shows how to enable and access Coherence MBeans using Management over REST.

Once the Management port has been exposed, for example via a load balancer or port-forward command, the REST
endpoint is available at `http://host:port/management/coherence/cluster`.
The Swagger JSON document for the API is available at `http://host:port/management/coherence/cluster/metadata-catalog`.

See the https://docs.oracle.com/en/middleware/standalone/coherence/14.1.1.0/rest-reference/[REST API for Managing Oracle Coherence]
documentation for full details on each of the endpoints.

NOTE: Note: Use of Management over REST is available only when using the operator with clusters running
Coherence 12.2.1.4 or later version.

=== Deploy Coherence with Management over REST Enabled

To deploy a `Coherence` resource with management over REST enabled and exposed on a port, the simplest yaml
would look like this:

[source,yaml]
.management-cluster.yaml
----
apiVersion: coherence.oracle.com/v1
kind: Coherence
metadata:
  name: management-cluster
spec:
  coherence:
    management:
      enabled: true     # <1>
  ports:
    - name: management  # <2>
----
<1> Setting the `coherence.management.enabled` field to `true` will enable Management over REST
<2> To expose Management over REST via a `Service` it is added to the `ports` list.
The `management` port is a special case where the `port` number is optional so in this case Management over REST
will bind to the default port `30000`.
(see <<ports/020_container_ports.adoc,Exposing Ports>> for details)

To expose Management over REST on a different port the alternative port value can be set in the `coherence.management`
section, for example:
[source,yaml]
.management-cluster.yaml
----
apiVersion: coherence.oracle.com/v1
kind: Coherence
metadata:
  name: management-cluster
spec:
  coherence:
    management:
      enabled: true
      port: 8080      # <1>
  ports:
    - name: management
----
<1> Management over REST will now be exposed on port `8080`


=== Port-forward the Management over REST Port

After installing the basic `management-cluster.yaml` from the first example above there would be a three member
Coherence cluster installed into Kubernetes.

For example, the cluster can be installed with `kubectl`
[source,bash]
----
kubectl -n coherence-test create -f management-cluster.yaml

coherence.coherence.oracle.com/management-cluster created
----

The `kubectl` CLI can be used to list `Pods` for the cluster:
[source,bash]
----
kubectl -n coherence-test get pod -l coherenceCluster=management-cluster

NAME                   READY   STATUS    RESTARTS   AGE
management-cluster-0   1/1     Running   0          36s
management-cluster-1   1/1     Running   0          36s
management-cluster-2   1/1     Running   0          36s
----

In a test or development environment the simplest way to reach an exposed port is to use the `kubectl port-forward` command.
For example to connect to the first `Pod` in the deployment:
[source,bash]
----
kubectl -n coherence-test port-forward management-cluster-0 30000:30000

Forwarding from [::1]:30000 -> 30000
Forwarding from 127.0.0.1:30000 -> 30000
----

=== Access the REST Endpoint
Now that a port is being forwarded from localhost to a `Pod` in the cluster the Management over REST endpoints can be accessed.

Issue the following `curl` command to access the REST endpoint:
[source,bash]
----
curl http://127.0.0.1:30000/management/coherence/cluster/
----

Which should result in a response similar to the following:
[source,json]
----

  ],

=== Access the Swagger Endpoint

Issue the following `curl` command to access the Sagger endpoint, which documents all the REST API's available.

[source,bash]
----
curl http://127.0.0.1:30000/management/coherence/cluster/metadata-catalog
----

Which should result in a response like the following:
[source,json]
----
{
  "swagger": "2.0",
  "info": {
    "title": "RESTful Management Interface for Oracle Coherence MBeans",
    "description": "RESTful Management Interface for Oracle Coherence MBeans",
    "version": "14.1.1.0.0"
  },
  "schemes": [
    "http",
    "https"
  ],
...
----

NOTE: The above output has been truncated due to the large size.

=== Other REST Resources

Management over REST can be used for all Coherence management functions, the same as would be available when using
standard MBean access over JMX.

Please see the
