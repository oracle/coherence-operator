== Coherence Clusters on OpenShift

Whilst the Coherence Operator will run out of the box on OpenShift some earlier versions of the Coherence Docker
image will not work without configuration changes.

These earlier versions of the Coherence Docker images that Oracle publishes default the container user
as `oracle`. When running the Oracle images or layered images that retain the default user as `oracle`
with OpenShift, the `anyuid` security context constraint is required to ensure proper access to the file
system within the Docker image. Later versions of the Coherence images have been modified to work without
needing `anyuid`.


To work with older image versions , the administrator must:

* Ensure the `anyuid` security content is granted
* Ensure that Coherence containers are annotated with `openshift.io/scc: anyuid`

For example, to update the OpenShift policy, use:
[source,bash]
----
oc adm policy add-scc-to-user anyuid -z default
----

and to annotate the Coherence containers, update the `Coherence` resource to include annotations

For example:
[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: coherence.oracle.com/v1
kind: Coherence
metadata:
  name: test-cluster
spec:
  annotations:
    openshift.io/scc: anyuid  # <1>
----

<1> The `openshift.io/scc: anyuid` annotation will be applied to all of the Coherence Pods.

NOTE: For additional information about OpenShift requirements see the
