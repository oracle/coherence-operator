= Set the Working Directory

== Set the Working Directory

When running a custom application there may be a requirement to run in a specific working directory.
The working directory can be specified in the `application.workingDir` field in the `Coherence` spec.

For example, a deployment uses a custom image `catalogue:1.0.0` that requires a custom main class
called `com.acme.Catalogue`, and that class takes additional arguments.
In this example we'll use two fictitious arguments such as a name and a language for the catalogue.
the `Coherence` resource would look like this:

[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: coherence.oracle.com/v1
kind: Coherence
metadata:
  name: test
spec:
  image: catalogue:1.0.0          # <1>
  application:
    workingDir: "/apps/catalogue" # <2>
    main: "com.acme.Catalogue"    # <3>
----
<1> The `catalogue:1.0.0` image will be used.
<2> The Java command will be executed in the `/apps/catalogue` working directory.
<3> The Java main class executed will be `com.acme.Catalogue`

The example would be equivalent to the Coherence container running:
[source,bash]
----
$ cd /apps/catalogue
$ java com.acme.Catalogue
----
