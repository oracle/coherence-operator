= Deploy Coherence Applications

== Deploy Coherence Application Images

Once a custom application image has been built (as described in <<applications/020_build_application.adoc,Build Custom Application Images>>)
a `Coherence` resource can be configured to use that image.


=== Specify the Image to Use

To specify the image to use set the `image` field in the `Coherence` spec to the name of the image.

For example if there was an application image called `catalogue:1.0.0` it can be specified like this:
[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: coherence.oracle.com/v1
kind: Coherence
metadata:
  name: test
spec:
  image: catalogue:1.0.0  # <1>
----
<1> The `catalogue:1.0.0` will be used in the `coherence` container in the deployment's Pods.

The example above would assume that the `catalogue:1.0.0` has a JVM on the `PATH` and all the required `.jar` files,
or Java classes, in the default classpath locations used by the Operator.
When this is not the case additional configuration can be added to specify additional application settings, these include:

* setting the <<jvm/020_classpath.adoc,classpath>>
* specifying the <<applications/040_application_main.adoc,application main>>
* specifying <<applications/050_application_args.adoc,application arguments>>
* specifying the <<applications/060_application_working_dir.adoc,working directory>>
