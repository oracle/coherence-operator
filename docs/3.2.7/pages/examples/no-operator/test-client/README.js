<p>In the <code>examples/no-operator/test-client/</code> directory is a simple Maven project that we will use to run a simple Extend client.
This will allow us to show connectivity to our test cluster from outside of Kubernetes.</p>

<p>To run the test client we can run this command from the <code>test-client/</code> directory:</p>

<markup
lang="bash"

>mvn exec:java</markup>

<p>This will start a Coherence interactive console as an Extend client.
We can then run various commands to test Extend connectivity.</p>
