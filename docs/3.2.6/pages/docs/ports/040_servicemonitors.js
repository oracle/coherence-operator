<div class="section">
<p>When a port exposed on a container is to be used to serve metrics to Prometheus this often requires the addition of
a Prometheus <code>ServiceMonitor</code> resource. The Coherence Operator makes it simple to add a <code>ServiceMonitor</code> for an exposed
port. The advantage of specifying the <code>ServiceMonitor</code> configuration in the <code>Coherence</code> CRD spec is that the
<code>ServiceMonitor</code> resource will be created, updated and deleted as part of the lifecycle of the <code>Coherence</code> resource,
and does not need to be managed separately.</p>

<p>A <code>ServiceMonitor</code> is created for an exposed port by setting the <code>serviceMonitor.enabled</code> field to <code>true</code>.
The Operator will create a <code>ServiceMonitor</code> with the same name as the <code>Service</code>.
The <code>ServiceMonitor</code> created will have a single endpoint for the port being exposed.</p>

<p>For example:</p>

<markup
lang="yaml"

>apiVersion: coherence.oracle.com/v1
kind: Coherence
metadata:
  name: test-cluster
spec:
  ports:
    - name: rest
      port: 8080
      serviceMonitor:
        enabled: true  <span class="conum" data-value="1" /></markup>

<ul class="colist">
<li data-value="1">With the <code>serviceMonitor.enabled</code> field set to <code>true</code> a <code>ServiceMonitor</code> resource will be created.</li>
</ul>
<p>The <code>ServiceMonitor</code> created from the spec above will look like this:
For example:</p>

<markup
lang="yaml"

>apiVersion: monitoring.coreos.com/v1
kind: ServiceMonitor
metadata:
  name: test-cluster-rest
  labels:
    coherenceCluster: test-cluster
    coherenceComponent: coherence-service-monitor
    coherenceDeployment: test-cluster
    coherenceRole: test-cluster
spec:
  endpoints:
    - port: rest
      relabelings:
        - action: labeldrop
          regex: (endpoint|instance|job|service)
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      coherenceCluster: test-cluster
      coherenceComponent: coherence-service
      coherenceDeployment: test-cluster
      coherencePort: rest
      coherenceRole: test-cluster</markup>

<div class="section">
<p>The <code>Coherence</code> CRD <router-link :to="{path: '/docs/about/04_coherence_spec', hash: '#_servicemonitorspec'}">ServiceMonitorSpec</router-link>
contains many of the fields from the
<a id="" title="" target="_blank" href="https://coreos.com/operators/prometheus/docs/latest/api.html#servicemonitorspec">Prometheus <code>ServiceMonitorSpec</code></a>
and <a id="" title="" target="_blank" href="https://coreos.com/operators/prometheus/docs/latest/api.html#endpoint">Prometheus Endpoint</a>
to allow the <code>ServiceMonitor</code> to be configured for most use-cases.</p>

<p>In situations where the <code>Coherence</code> CRD does not have the required fields, for example when a different version
of Prometheus has been installed to that used to build the Coherence Operator, then the solution would be to
manually create <code>ServiceMonitors</code> instead of letting them be created by the Coherence Operator.</p>
