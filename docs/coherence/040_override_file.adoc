== Set the Operational Configuration File Name

The name of the Coherence operations configuration file (commonly called the overrides file) that the Coherence processes
in a `Coherence` resource will use can be set with the `spec.coherence.overrideConfig` field.
By setting this field the `coherence.override` system property will be set in the Coherence JVM.

When the `spec.coherence.overrideConfig` is blank or not specified, Coherence use its default behaviour to find the
operational configuration file to use. Typically, this is to use the first occurrence of `tangosol-coherence-override.xml`
that is found on the classpath
(consult the https://{commercial-docs-base-url}/develop-applications/understanding-configuration.html#GUID-360B798E-2120-44A9-8B09-1FDD9AB40EB5[Coherence documentation]
for an explanation of the default behaviour).

To set a specific operational configuration file to use set the `spec.coherence.overrideConfig` field, for example:
[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: coherence.oracle.com/v1
kind: Coherence
metadata:
  name: storage
spec:
  coherence:
    overrideConfig: test-override.xml # <1>
----

<1> The `spec.coherence.overrideConfig` field has been set to `test-override.xml` which will effectively pass
`-Dcoherence.override=test-override.xml` to the JVM command line.
