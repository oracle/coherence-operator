= Coherence Log Level

== Set the Coherence Log Level
Logging granularity in Coherence is controlled by a log level, that is a number between one and nine,
where the higher the number the more debug logging is produced. The `Coherence` CRD has a field
`spec.coherence.logLevel` that allows the log level to be configured by setting the `coherence.log.level`
system property.

<1> The `Coherence` spec sets the log level to 9, effectively passing `-Dcoherence.log.level=9` to the Coherence
JVM's command line.
