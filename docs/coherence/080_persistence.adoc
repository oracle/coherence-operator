= Coherence Persistence

Coherence persistence is a set of tools and technologies that manage the persistence and recovery of Coherence
distributed caches. Cached data can be persisted so that it can be quickly recovered after a catastrophic failure
or after a cluster restart due to planned maintenance. Persistence and federated caching can be used together
as required.

== Configure Coherence Persistence

The `Coherence` CRD allows the default persistence mode, and the storage location of persistence data to be
configured. Persistence can be configured in the `spec.coherence.persistence` section of the CRD.
See the https://docs.oracle.com/en/middleware/standalone/coherence/14.1.1.0/administer/persisting-caches.html#GUID-3DC46E44-21E4-4DC4-9D12-231DE57FE7A1[Coherence Persistence]
documentation for more details of how persistence works and its configuration.

== Persistence Mode

There are three default persistence modes available, `active`, `active-async` and `on-demand`; the default mode is `on-demand`.
The persistence mode will be set using the `spec.coherence.persistence,mode` field in the CRD. The value of this field will be
used to set the `coherence.distributed.persistence-mode` system property in the Coherence JVM.

For example:
[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: coherence.oracle.com/v1
kind: Coherence
metadata:
  name: storage
spec:
  coherence:
    persistence:
      mode: active  #<1>
----
<1> The example above sets the persistence mode to `active` which will effectively pass
`-Dcoherence.distributed.persistence-mode=active` to the Coherence JVM's command line.


== Persistence Storage

The purpose of persistence in Coherence is to store data on disc so that it is available outside of the lifetime of the
JVMs that make up the cluster. In a containerised environment like Kubernetes this means storing that data in storage that
also lives outside of the containers.

When persistence storage has been configured a `VolumeMount` will be added to the Coherence container mounted at `/persistence`,
and the `coherence.distributed.persistence.base.dir` system property will be configured to point to the storage location.

=== Using a PersistentVolumeClaim

The Coherence Operator creates a `StatefulSet` for each `Coherence` resource, so the
logical place to store persistence data is in a `PersistentVolumeClaim`.

The PVC used for persistence can be configured in the `spec.coherence.persistence.persistentVolumeClaim` section
of the CRD.

[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: coherence.oracle.com/v1
kind: Coherence
metadata:
  name: storage
spec:
  coherence:
    persistence:
      persistentVolumeClaim:     # <1>
        storageClassName: "SSD"
        accessModes:
          - ReadWriteOnce
        resources:
          requests:
            storage: 50Gi
----

<1> The example above configures a 50GB PVC with a storage class name of "SSD"
(assuming the Kubernetes cluster has a storage class of that name configured).

The configuration under the `spec.coherence.persistence.persistentVolumeClaim` section is exactly the same as
configuring a PVC for a normal Kubernetes Pod and all the possible options are beyond the scope of this document.
For more details on configuring PVC, see the Kubernetes
https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/storage/persistent-volumes/[Persistent Volumes] documentation.

=== Using a Normal Volume

An alternative to a PVC is to use a normal Kubernetes Volume to store the persistence data.
An example of this use-case could be when the Kubernetes Nodes that the Coherence Pods are scheduled onto have locally
attached fast SSD drives, which is ideal storage for persistence.
In this case a normal Volume can be configured in the `spec.coherence.persistence.volume` section of the CRD.

[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: coherence.oracle.com/v1
kind: Coherence
metadata:
  name: storage
spec:
  coherence:
    persistence:                                 # <1>
      volume:
        hostPath:
          path: /mnt/ssd/coherence/persistence
----

<1> In the example above a Volume has been configured for persistence, in this case a `HostPath` volume pointing to
the `/mnt/ssd/coherence/persistence` directory on the Node.

The configuration under the `spec.coherence.persistence.volume` section is a normal Kubernetes
https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/generated/kubernetes-api/v1.18/#volume-v1-core[VolumeSource]
so any valid `VolumeSource` configuration can be used.
See the Kubernetes https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/storage/volumes/[Volumes] documentation for more details.


== Snapshot Storage

Coherence allows on-demand snapshots to be taken of cache data. With the default configuration the snapshot files will
be stored under the same persistence root location as active persistence data.
The `Coherence` spec allows a different location to be specified for storage of snapshot files so that active data
and snapshot data can be stored in different locations and/or on different storage types in Kubernetes.

The same two options are available for snapshot storage that are available for persistence storage, namely PVCs and
normal Volumes. The `spec.coherence.persistence.snapshots` section is used to configure snapshot storage.
When this is used a `VolumeMount` will be added to the Coherence container with a mount path of `/snapshots`,
and the `coherence.distributed.persistence.snapshot.dir` system property will be set to point to this location.

=== Snapshots Using a PersistentVolumeClaim

A PVC can be configured for persistence snapshot data as shown below.

[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: coherence.oracle.com/v1
kind: Coherence
metadata:
  name: storage
spec:
  coherence:
    persistence:                                 # <1>
      volume:
        hostPath:
          path: /mnt/ssd/coherence/persistence
      snapshots:
        persistentVolumeClaim:                   # <2>
          resources:
            requests:
              storage: 50Gi
----
<1> Active persistence data will be stored on a normal Volume using a HostPath volume source.
<2> Snapshot data will be stored in a 50GB PVC.

=== Snapshots Using a Normal Volumes

A normal volume can be configured for snapshot data as shown below.

[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: coherence.oracle.com/v1
kind: Coherence
metadata:
  name: storage
spec:
  coherence:
    persistence:                                 # <1>
      volume:
        hostPath:
          path: /mnt/ssd/coherence/persistence
      snapshots:
        volume:
          hostPath:
            path: /mnt/ssd/coherence/snapshots   # <2>
----
<1> Active persistence data will be stored on a normal Volume using a HostPath volume source.
<2> Snapshot data will be stored on a normal Volume using a different HostPath volume source.
