= Using Kibana Dashboards

== Using Kibana Dashboards

Kibana is often used to anyalze log files that have been collected into Elasticsearch.
The Coherence Operator provides a number of Kibana dashboards and queries
to allow you to view and analyze logs from your Coherence clusters.

=== Importing Kibana Dashboards

The Kibana dashboard files are located in the Coherence operator source in the `dashboards/kibana` directory.

The method of importing the dashboards into Kibana will depend on how Kibana is being run.
The simplest method is just to import the json file using the Kibana web UI.
An alternative approach is to load the dashboard into a `ConfigMap` in Kubernetes that is mounted into the Kibana Pod
and then trigger an import when Kibana starts.
As there are many ways to do this depending on the specifics of the version of Kibana being used,
exact instructions are beyond the scope fo this guide.

[#dashboards]
=== Dashboards

Information from all dashboards (and queries) can be filtered using the standard Kibana date/time
filtering in the top right of the UI, as well as the `Add a filter` button.

[#all]
==== 1. Coherence Cluster - All Messages

This dashboard shows all messages captured for the given time period for all clusters.

Users can drill-down by cluster, host, message level and thread.

[#errors]
==== 2. Coherence Cluster - Errors and Warnings

This dashboard shows errors and warning messages only.

Users can drill-down by cluster, host, message level and thread.

[#searches]
=== Searches

A number of searches are automatically includes which can help assist in
diagnosis and troubleshooting a Coherence cluster. They can be accessed via the `Discover` `side-bar
and selecting `Open`.

These are grouped into the following general categories:

* Cluster - Cluster join, discovery, heartbeat, member joining and stopping messages

* Cache - Cache restarting, exceptions and index exception messages

* Configuration - Configuration loading and not loading messages

* Persistence - Persistence success and failure messages

* Network - Network communications delays, disconnects, timeouts and terminations

* Partition - Partition loss, ownership and transfer related messages

* Member - Member thread dump, join and leave messages

* Errors - All Error messages only

* Federation - Federation participant, disconnection, connection, errors and other messages
