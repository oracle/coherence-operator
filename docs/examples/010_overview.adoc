= Overview

This section includes links to a number of examples which uses the Coherence Operator.

== Examples Overview

There are a number of examples which show you how to build and deploy applications for the Coherence Operator.

=== 1. Deployment Example

This example showcases how to deploy Coherence applications using the Coherence Operator.

The following scenarios are covered:

1. Installing the Coherence Operator
1. Installing a Coherence cluster
1. Deploying a Proxy tier
1. Deploying an storage-disabled application
1. Enabling Active Persistence

After the initial install of the Coherence cluster, the following examples build on the previous ones by issuing a kubectl apply to modify the install adding additional roles.

Please see https://github.com/oracle/coherence-operator/tree/master/examples/deployment[GitHub] for full instructions.

=== 2. Coherence Demo

The Coherence Demonstration application is an application which demonstrates various Coherence
related features such include Persistence, Federation and Lambda support.  This demonstration
can run stand alone but can also be installed on the Coherence Operator.

When installed using the Coherence Operator, the setup includes two Coherence Clusters, in the same Kubernetes cluster,
which are configured with Active/Active Federation.
