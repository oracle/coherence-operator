The Elastic Data feature is used to seamlessly store data across memory and disk-based devices.
This feature is especially tuned to take advantage of the fast disk-based devices, such as, Solid State Disks (SSD) and enables near memory speed while storing and reading data from SSDs. The Elastic Data feature uses a technique called journaling to optimize the storage across memory and disk.
