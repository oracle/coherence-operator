= Logging Configuration

There are various settings in a Coherence role that control different aspects of logging, including the Coherence
log level, configuration files and whether Fluentd log capture is enabled.

== Logging Configuration

Logging configuration for a role is defined in the `logging` section of the role's `spec`. There are a number of different
fields used to configure different logging features. The `logging` configuration can be set at different places depending
on whether the implicit role or explicit roles are being configured.

[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: coherence.oracle.com/v1
kind: CoherenceCluster
metadata:
  name: test-cluster
spec:
  coherence:
    logLevel: 9
  logging:
    configFile:    app-logging.properties
    configMapName: logging-cm
    fluentd:
      enabled: true
      image: fluent/fluentd-kubernetes-daemonset:v1.3.3-debian-elasticsearch-1.3
      imagePullPolicy: IfNotPresent
      configFile: fluentd-config.yaml
      tag: test-cluster
----

The fields in the example above are described in detail in the following sections.


=== Coherence Log Level

The Coherence log level is set with the `coherence.logLevel` field. This field is an integer value between zero and nine
(see the Coherence documentation for a fuller explanation).

To set the Coherence log level when defining the implicit role:

[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: coherence.oracle.com/v1
kind: CoherenceCluster
metadata:
  name: test-cluster
spec:
  coherence:
    logLevel: 5  # <1>
----

<1> The implicit role will have a Coherence log level of `5`

To set the log level for explicit roles in the `roles` list:

[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: coherence.oracle.com/v1
kind: CoherenceCluster
metadata:
  name: test-cluster
spec:
  roles:
    - role: data
      coherence:
        logLevel: 9 # <1>
    - role: proxy
      coherence:
        logLevel: 5 # <2>
----

<1> The `data` role will have a Coherence log level of `9`
<2> The `proxy` role will have a Coherence log level of `5`

To set the log level for explicit roles in the `roles` list:

[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: coherence.oracle.com/v1
kind: CoherenceCluster
metadata:
  name: test-cluster
spec:
  coherence:
    logLevel: 9      # <1>
  roles:
    - role: data
    - role: proxy
    - role: web
      coherence:
        logLevel: 5  # <2>
----

<1> The `data` and `proxy` roles will use the default Coherence log level of `9`
<2> The `web` role overrides the default Coherence log level setting it to `5`


=== Logging Config File

The default logging configuration for Coherence clusters started by the Coherence Operator is to set Coherence to used
JDK logging; the JDK logger is then configured with a configuration file. The default configuration file is embedded into
the Pod by the Coherence Operator but this default my be overridden; for example an application deployed into the cluster
may require different logging configurations. The name of the file is provided in the `logging.configFile` field.
The logging configuration file must be available to the JVM when it starts, either by providing it in
<<clusters/065_application_image.adoc,application code>> or by <<clusters/150_volumes.adoc,mounting a volume>> containing
the file, or by using a <<configmap,ConfigMap>>.

To set the logging configuration file when defining the implicit role:

[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: coherence.oracle.com/v1
kind: CoherenceCluster
metadata:
  name: test-cluster
spec:
  logging:
    configFile: app-logging.properties <1>
----

<1> The implicit role will use the `app-logging.properties` logging configuration file


To set the logging configuration file when defining explicit roles in the `roles` list:

[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: coherence.oracle.com/v1
kind: CoherenceCluster
metadata:
  name: test-cluster
spec:
  roles:
    - role: data
      logging:
        configFile: data-logging.properties   # <1>
    - role: proxy
      logging:
        configFile: proxy-logging.properties  # <2>
----

<1> The `data` role will use the `data-logging.properties` logging configuration file
<2> The `proxy` role will use the `proxy-logging.properties` logging configuration file


To set a default logging configuration file when defining explicit roles in the `roles` list:

[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: coherence.oracle.com/v1
kind: CoherenceCluster
metadata:
  name: test-cluster
spec:
  logging:
    configFile: app-logging.properties     # <1>
  roles:
    - role: data
    - role: proxy
    - role: web
      logging:
        configFile: web-logging.properties # <2>
----

<1> The `app-logging.properties` logging configuration file is set as the default ans will be used by the `data` and
`proxy` roles.
<2> The `web` role has a specific configuration file set and will use the `web-logging.properties` file


[#configmap]
=== Logging ConfigMap

The `logging.ConfigMap` field can be used to specify the name of a `ConfigMap` that contains the logging configuration file
to use. The `ConfigMap` should exist in the same namespace as the Coherence cluster.

TBD...

== Fluentd Logging Configuration
The Coherence Operator allows Coherence cluster `Pods` to be configured with a Fluentd side-car container that will push
Coherence logs to Elasticsearch. The configuration for Fluentd is in the `logging.fluentd` section of the spec.

TBD...
