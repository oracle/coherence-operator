= CoherenceCluster CRD Overview

Creating a Coherence cluster using the Coherence Operator is as simple as creating any other Kubernetes resource.

== CoherenceCluster CRD Overview

The Coherence Operator uses a Kubernetes `CustomResourceDefinition` named `CoherenceCluster` to define the `spec` for a
Coherence cluster.
All of the fields of the `CoherenceCluster` crd are optional so a Coherence cluster can be created with yaml as
simple as the following:

[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: coherence.oracle.com/v1
kind: CoherenceCluster
metadata:
  name: my-cluster  # <1>
----

<1> The `metadata.name` field will be used as the Coherence cluster name.

The yaml above will create a Coherence cluster with three storage enabled members. 
There is not much that can actually be achived with this cluster because no ports are exposed outside of Kubernetes
so the cluster is inaccessible. It could be possibly be accessed by other `Pods` in the same Kubernetes cluster but
in most use cases additional configuration would be required.

== Coherence Roles

A role is what is actually configured in the `CoherenceCluster` spec. In a traditional Coherence application that may have
had a number of storage enabled members and a number of storage disable Coherence*Extend proxy members this cluster would
have effectively had two roles, "storage" and "proxy".
Some clusters may simply have just a storage role and some complex Coherence applications and clusters may have many roles
and even different roles storage enabled for different caches/services within the same cluster.

A role in a `CoherenceCluster` is either configured as a single implicit `role` or one or more explicit `roles`.

[source,yaml]
.Single Implicit Role
----
apiVersion: coherence.oracle.com/v1
kind: CoherenceCluster
metadata:
  name: my-cluster
spec:               # <1>
  replicas: 6
----

<1> The configuration for the `role` (in this case just the `replicas` field) is added directly to the `spec` section
of the `CoherenceCluster`.

[source,yaml]
.Single Explicit Role
----
apiVersion: coherence.oracle.com/v1
kind: CoherenceCluster
metadata:
  name: my-cluster
spec:
  roles:
  - role: data # <1>
    replicas: 6
----

<1> The configuration for a single explicit `role` named `data` is added to the `roles` list.
of the `CoherenceCluster`.

[source,yaml]
.Multiple Explicit Roles
----
apiVersion: coherence.oracle.com/v1
kind: CoherenceCluster
metadata:
  name: my-cluster
spec:
  roles:
  - role: data   # <1>
    replicas: 6
  - role: data   # <2>
    replicas: 3
----

<1> The first role in the `roles` list is named `data` with a `replicas` value of `6`
<2> The second role in the `roles` list is named `proxy` with a `replicas` value of `3`


== The Coherence Role Specification

The specification for a `role` in the `CoherenceCluster` CRD (both implicit or expilict) has the following top level
fields that may be configured:

[source,yaml]
----
  role:                      # <1>
  replicas:                  # <2>
  application: {}            # <3>
  coherence: {}              # <4>
  jvm: {}                    # <5>
  scaling: {}                # <6>
  ports: []                  # <7>
  logging: {}                # <8>
  volumes: []                # <9>
  volumeClaimTemplates: []   # <10>
  volumeMounts: []           # <11>
  env: []                    # <12>
  annotations: {}            # <13>
  labels: []                 # <14>
  nodeSelector: {}           # <15>
  tolerations: []            # <16>
  affinity: {}               # <17>
  resources: {}              # <18>
  readinessProbe: {}         # <19>
  livenessProbe: {}          # <20>
----

<1> The `role` field sets the name of the role, if omitted the default name of `storage` will be used. If configuring
multiple roles in a `CoherenceCluster` each role must have a unique name.
See <<clusters/030_roles.adoc,Define Coherence Roles>> for more details.
<2> The `replicas` field sets the number of replicas (`Pods`) that will be vreated for the role. If not specified the
default value is `3`.
See configuring a <<clusters/040_replicas.adoc,Role's Replica Count>> for more details.
<3> The `application` section contains fields for configuring custom application code.
See <<clusters/070_applications.adoc,Configure Applications>> for more details.
<4> The `coherence` section contains fields for configuring Coherence specific settings.

and down.
See <<clusters/085_safe_scaling.adoc,Configure Safe Scaling>> for more details.

See <<clusters/090_ports_and_services.adoc,Expose Ports and Services>> for more details.
<8> The `logging` section contains fields for configuring logging.

<10> The `volumeClaimTemplates` section contains fields for configuring additional PVCs to add to the `Pods` for a role.

See <<clusters/110_volumes.adoc,Configure Additional Volumes>> for more details.
<12> The `env` section contains extra environment variables to add to the Coherence container.

<14> The `labels` map contains extra labels to add to the `Pods` for the role.

<15> The `nodeSelector` map contains node selectors to determine how Kubernetes schedules the `Pods` in the role.
