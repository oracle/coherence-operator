= Expose Ports and Services

== Expose Ports and Services

Any ports that are used by Coherence or by application code that need to be exposed outside of the `Pods` for a role
need to be declared in the `CoherenceCluster` spec for the role.

== Default Ports
The Coherence container in `Pods` in a role in a `CoherenceCluster` has two ports declared by default, none of the ports
are exposed on services.

[cols=3*,options=header]
|===
|Port
|Name
|Description

|`7`
|`coherence`
|This is the standard echo port. Nothing in the container binds to this port it is only declared on the container so
that the headless `Service` used for Coherence WKA can declare a port.

|`6676`
| `health`
| This is the port used to expose the default readiness, liveness and StatusHA ReST endpoints on.

|===

NOTE: When exposing additional ports as described in the sections below the names for the additional ports cannot be
either `coherence` or `health` that are the names used for the default ports above or the `Pods` may fail to start.


== Configure Additional Ports

Additional ports can be declared for a role by adding them to the `ports` array that is part of the `role` spec.
A `port` has the following fields:

[source,yaml]
----
ports:
  - name: extend   # <1>
    port: 20000    # <2>
    protocol: TCP  # <3>
    service: {}    # <4>
----

<1> The port must have a `name` that is unique within the role
<2> The `port` value must be specified
<3> The `protocol` is optional and defaults to `TCP`. The valid values are the same as when declaring ports for
https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/services-networking/service/[Kubernetes services] and `Pods`.
<4> The `service` section is optional and is used to configure the `Service` that will be used to expose the port.
see <<#services,Configure Services for Additional Ports>>

By default a Kubernetes `Service` of type `ClusterIP` will be created for each additional port. The `Service` `port`
and `targetPort` will both default to the specified `port` value. The `port` value for the `Service` can be overridden
in the `service` spec.

The name of the `Service` created will default to a name made up from the cluster name, the role name and the port name
in the format `<cluster-name>-<role-name>-<port-name>`. This can be overriden by specifying a different name in the
`service` section of the additional port configuration.

For example:
[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: coherence.oracle.com/v1
kind: CoherenceCluster
metadata:
  name: test-cluster  # <1>
spec:
  role: data          # <2>
  ports:
    - name: extend    # <3>
      port: 20000
----

<1> The cluster name is `test-cluster`
<2> The role name is `data`
<3> The port name is `extend`

The `Service` created for the `extend` port would be:
[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: v1
kind: Service
metadata:
  name: test-cluster-data-extend  # <1>
----

<1> the `Service` name is `test-cluster-data-extend` made up of the cluster name `test-cluster` the role name `data`
and the port name `extend`.

=== Configure Additional Ports for the Implicit Role

When configuring a `CoherenceCluster` with a single implicit role the additional ports are added to the `ports` array
in the `CoherenceCluster` `spec` section.
For Example:

[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: coherence.oracle.com/v1
kind: CoherenceCluster
metadata:
  name: test-cluster
spec:
  ports:            # <1>
    - name: extend
      port: 20000
    - name: rest
      port: 8080
----

<1> The `ports` array for the single implicit role contains two additional ports. The first named `extend` on port
`20000` and the second named `rest` on port `8080`. Both of the ports in the above example will be exposed on separate
`Services` using the default service configuration.


=== Configure Additional Ports for Explicit Roles

When configuring a `CoherenceCluster` with explicit roles in the `roles` list the additional ports are added to
the `ports` array for each role.
For Example:

[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: coherence.oracle.com/v1
kind: CoherenceCluster
metadata:
  name: test-cluster
spec:
  roles:
    - role: data             # <1>
      ports:
        - name: management
          port: 30000
    - role: proxy            # <2>
      ports:
        - name: extend
          port: 20000
----

<1> The `data` role adds an additional port named `management` with a port value of `30000` that will be exposed on
a service named `test-cluster-data-management`.
<2> The `proxy` role adds an additional port named `extend` with a port value of `20000` that will be exposed on
a service named `test-cluster-data-extend`.



=== Configure Additional Ports for Explicit Roles with Defaults

When configuring a `CoherenceCluster` with explicit roles default additional ports can be added to the
`CoherenceCluster` `spec.ports` array that will apply to all roles in the `roles` list.
Additional ports can then also be specified for individual roles in the `roles` list.
The `ports` array for an individual role will then be a *merge* of the default ports and the role's ports.
If a port in a role has the same name as a default port then the role's port will override the default port.

For Example:

[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: coherence.oracle.com/v1
kind: CoherenceCluster
metadata:
  name: test-cluster
spec:
  ports:                   # <1>
    - name: management
      port: 30000
  roles:
    - role: data           # <2>
    - role: proxy
      ports:
        - name: extend     # <3>
          port: 20000
    - role: web
      ports:
        - name: http       # <4>
          port: 8080
        - name: management # <5>
          port: 9000
----

<1> The default additional ports section specifies a single additional port named `management` on port `30000`.

<2> The `data` role does not specify any additional ports so will just have the default additional `management` port
that will be exposed on a service named `test-cluster-data-management`.

<3> The `proxy` role adds an additional port named `extend` with a port value of `20000` that will be exposed on
a service named `test-cluster-data-extend`. The `proxy` role will also have the default additional `management` port
exposed on a service named `test-cluster-proxy-management`.

<4> The `web` role specified an additional port named `http` on port `8080` that will be exposed on a service named
`test-cluster-web-http`.

<5> The `web` role also overrides the default `management` port changing the `port` value from `30000` to `9000`
that will be exposed on a service named `test-cluster-web-management`.



[#services]
== Configure Services for Additional Ports

A number of fields may be specified to configure the `Service` that will be created to expose the port.

[source,yaml]
----
  ports:
    - name: extend
      port: 20000
      protocol: TCP
      service:
        enabled: true                     # <1>
        name: test-cluster-data-extend    # <2>
        port: 20000                       # <3>
        type:
        externalName:
        sessionAffinity:
        publishNotReadyAddresses:
        externalTrafficPolicy:
        loadBalancerIP:
        healthCheckNodePort:
        loadBalancerSourceRanges: []
        annotations: {}
        sessionAffinityConfig: {}
----

<1> Optionally enable or disable creation of a `Service` for the port, the defautl value is `true`.
<2> Optionally override the default generated `Service` name.
<3> Optionally use a different port in the `Service` to that used by the `Container`.

Apart from the `enabled` and `name` fields, all of the fields shown above have exactly the same meaning and default
behaviour that they do for a normal https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/services-networking/service/[Kubernetes Service]


=== Enabling or Disabling Service Creation

By default a `Service` will be created for all additional ports in the `ports` array. If for some reason this is not
required `Service` creation can be disabled by setting the `service.enabled` field to `false`. The additional port
will still be added as a named port to the Coherence `Container` spec in the `Pod`.
For example:

[source,yaml]
----
  ports:
    - name: extend
      port: 20000
      protocol: TCP
      service:
        enabled: false
----


=== Changing a Service Name

As already described above the name of a `Service` created for an additional port is a combination of cluster name, role
name and port name. This can be overridden by setting the `service.name` field to the required name of the `Service`.

NOTE: Bear in mind when overriding `Service` names that they must be unique within the Kubernetes namespace that the
`CoherenceCluster` is being installed into.

For example:

[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: coherence.oracle.com/v1
kind: CoherenceCluster
metadata:
  name: test-cluster
spec:
  ports:
    - name: http
      port: 8080
      service:
        name: front-end
        port: 80
----

In the example above the service name has been overridden to be `front-end` and the service port overridden to `80`,
which will generate a `Service` like the following:

[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: v1
kind: Service
metadata:
  name: front-end        # <1>
spec:
  ports:
    - name: http         # <2>
      port: 80           # <3>
      targetPort: 8080   # <4>
----

<1> The `Service` name has been overridden to `front-end`
<2> The port name is `http` the same as the name of the additional port in the role spec.
<3> The `port` is `80` which is the value from the additional port's `service.port` field.
<4> The `targetPort` is `8080` which is the port that the container will use from the `port` value of the additional
port in the role spec.
