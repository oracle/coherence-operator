= Using Private Image Registries


== Using Private Image Registries

Sometimes the images used by a Coherence cluster need to be pulled from a private image registry that requires credentials.
The Coherence Operator supports supplying credentials in the `CoherenceCluster` configuration.
The Kubernetes documentation on https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/containers/images/#using-a-private-registry[ using a private registries]
gives a number of options for supplying credentials.

== Use ImagePullSecrets

Kubernetes supports configuring pods to use `imagePullSecrets` for pulling images. If possible, this is the preferable
and most portable route.
See the https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/containers/images/#specifying-imagepullsecrets-on-a-pod[kubernetes docs]
for this.
Once secrets have been created in the namespace that the `CoherenceCluster` is to be installed in then the secret name
can be specified in the `CoherenceCluster` `spec`. It is possible to specify multiple secrets in the case where the different
images being used are pulled from different registries.


[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: coherence.oracle.com/v1
kind: CoherenceCluster
metadata:
  name: test-cluster
spec:
  imagePullSecrets:
    - name: coherence-secret  # <1>
----

<1> The `coherence-secret` will be used for pulling images from the registry associated to the secret


The `imagePullSecrets` field is a list of values in the same format that they would be specified in Kubernetes `Pod`
specs, so multiple secrets can be specified for different authenticated registries in the case where the Coherence
cluster will use images from different authenticated registries..

[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: coherence.oracle.com/v1
kind: CoherenceCluster
metadata:
  name: test-cluster
spec:
  imagePullSecrets:     # <1>
    - name: coherence-secret
    - name: ocr-secret
----

<1> The `imagePullSecrets` list specifies two secrets to use `coherence-secret` and `ocr-secret`

Image pull secrets are only specified for the `CoherenceCluster` as a whole as there is no benefit to being able to
specify different secrets for different roles within a cluster.
