# Add application jars/Config to a Coherence deployment

A common scenario for Coherence deployments is to include specific configuration files, such as cache configuration 
operational override files, as well as user classes.

Using the `coherence-operator`, this is achieved by using the `sidecar` approach 
with the docker image having the following directories which are copied to the `coherence` container on startup
and available in the classpath.

This sample shows how to create a sidecar image which contains a cache configuration, POF configuration and
associated portable `Person` object. A client `SampleClient` runs and uses a lambda to modify data 
on the server side.

## Sample files

* [src/main/docker/Dockerfile](src/main/docker/Dockerfile) - Dockerfile for creating side-car image from which configuration
  and server side jar will be read from at pod startup

* [src/main/resources/conf/storage-cache-config.xml](src/main/resources/conf/storage-cache-config.xml) - cache config for storage-enabled tier

* [src/main/resources/conf/storage-pof-config.xml](src/main/resources/conf/storage-pof-config.xml) - POF cache config for storage-enabled tier

* [src/main/java/demo/Person.java](src/main/java/demo/Person.java) - domain class for storing Person

* [src/main/java/demo/SampleClient.java](src/main/java/demo/SampleClient.java) - Java client to connect via extend and run entry processor. 

## Prerequisites

Ensure you have already installed the Coherence Operator by using the instructions [here](../../README.md#install-the-coherence-operator).

## Installation Steps

1. Change to the `samples/coherence-deployments/sidecar` directory and ensure you have your maven build     
   environment set for JDK11 and build the project.

   ```bash
   mvn clean install -P docker
   ```

1. The result of the above is the docker image will be built with the cache configuration files
   and compiled Java classes with the name in the format sidecar-sample:${version}.

   For Example:

   ```bash
   sidecar-sample:1.0.0-SNAPSHOT
   ```

   > Note: If you are running against a remote Kubernetes cluster you will need to
   > push the above image to your repository accessible to that cluster. You will also need to 
   > prefix the image name in your `helm` command below.

1. Install the Coherence cluster

   ```bash
   $ helm install \
      --namespace sample-coherence-ns \
      --name storage \
      --set clusterSize=3 \
      --set cluster=sidecar-cluster \
      --set imagePullSecrets=sample-coherence-secret \
      --set store.cacheConfig=storage-cache-config.xml \
      --set store.pof.config=storage-pof-config.xml \
      --set prometheusoperator.enabled=false \
      --set logCaptureEnabled=false \
      --set userArtifacts.image=sidecar-sample:1.0.0-SNAPSHOT \
      --version 1.0.0-SNAPSHOT coherence-community/coherence
   ```

   Because we use stateful sets, the coherence cluster will start one pod at a time.
    
   Use `kubectl get pods -n sample-coherence-ns` to ensure that all pods are running.
   All 3 storage-coherence-0/1/2 pods should be running and ready, as below:

   ```bash
   NAME                 READY   STATUS    RESTARTS   AGE
   storage-coherence-0  1/1     Running   0          4m
   storage-coherence-1  1/1     Running   0          2m
   storage-coherence-2  1/1     Running   0          1m
   ```

1. Port-forward Coherence*Extend 

   Issue the following to port-forward default Coherence*Extend port.
   
   ```bash
   $ kubectl port-forward storage-coherence-0 -n sample-coherence-ns 20000:20000
   ```
   
1. Run the SampleClient and connect via Coherence*Extend

   Issue the following to run the `SampleClient.java` class to insert a Person and
   run a server-side Lambda entry processor to change name and address to uppercase. 
   The execution of this entry processor shows that the Coherence cluster 
   is aware of the Person object.
   
   ```bash
   $ mvn exec:java
   ...

   Person after entry processor is: Person{Id=1, Name='TOM JONES', Address='123 HOLLYWOOD AVE, CALIFORNIA, USA'}
   ```

## Uninstalling the Charts

Carry out the following commands to delete the chart installed in this sample.

```bash
helm delete storage --purge
```

Before starting another sample, ensure that all the pods are gone from previous sample.

If you wish to remove the `coherence-operator`, then include it in the `helm delete` command above.
