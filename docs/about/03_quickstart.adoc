= Quick Start

This guide is a simple set of steps to install the Coherence Operator and then use that
to install a simple Coherence cluster.

== Prerequisites

Ensure that the <<install/02_prerequisites.adoc,Coherence Operator prerequisites>> are available.

== 1. Install the Coherence Operator

=== 1.1 Add the Coherence Operator Helm repository

[source,bash]
----
helm repo add coherence https://oracle.github.io/coherence-operator/charts

helm repo update
----

=== 1.2. Install the Coherence Operator Helm chart

[source,bash]
----
helm install  \
    --namespace <namespace> \
    --name <release-name> \
    coherence/coherence-operator
----

NOTE: Use the same namespace that the operator was installed into,
e.g. if the namespace is `coherence` the command would be
`helm install --namespace coherence  --name operator coherence/coherence-operator`

See the <<install/01_introduction.adoc, full install guide>> for more details.

== 2. Install a Coherence Cluster

Ensure that the Coherence images can be pulled by the Kubernetes cluster
see <<04_obtain_coherence_images.adoc,Obtain Coherence Images>>
By default a `CoherenceCluster` will use images from Oracle Container Registry.
If a different registry is used the image name will need to be specified in the `CoherenceCluster` yaml,
see <<clusters/056_coherence_image.adoc,Setting the Coherence Image>> for documentation on how to
specify a different Coherence image to the default.


=== 2.1 Install a Coherence cluster using the minimal required configuration.

The minimal required yaml to create a `CoherenceCluster` resource is shown below.


[source,yaml]
.my-cluster.yaml
----
apiVersion: coherence.oracle.com/v1
kind: CoherenceCluster
metadata:
  name: my-cluster # <1>
----

The only required field is `metadata.name` which will be used as the Coherence cluster name, in this case `my-cluster`

```
kubectl -n <namespace> apply -f my-cluster.yaml
```

NOTE: Use the same namespace that the operator was installed into,
e.g. if the namespace is `coherence` the command would be
`kubectl -n coherence create -f my-cluster.yaml`


=== 2.2 List the Coherence Resources

After installing the `my-cluster.yaml` above here should be a single `coherencecluster` resource  named `my-cluster`
and a single `coherencerole` resource named `my-cluster-storage` created in the Coherence Operator namespace.

```
kubectl -n <namespace> get coherencecluster
```

NOTE: Use the same namespace that the operator was installed into, e.g. if the namespace is `coherence` the command
would be `kubectl -n coherence get coherence`

```
NAME                                                    AGE
coherencerole.coherence.oracle.com/my-cluster-storage   19s

NAME                                               AGE
coherencecluster.coherence.oracle.com/my-cluster   19s
```

See the <<clusters/020_k8s_resources.adoc,in-depth documentation>> on the Kubernetes resources created by the
Coherence Operator.

=== 2.3 List all of the `Pods` for the Coherence cluster.

The Coherence Operator applies a `coherenceCluster` label to all
of the `Pods` so this label can be used with the `kubectl` command to find `Pods` for a Coherence cluster.

```
kubectl -n <namespace> get pod -l coherenceCluster=my-cluster
```

NOTE: Use the same namespace that the operator was installed into,
e.g. if the namespace is `coherence` the command would be
`kubectl -n coherence get pod -l coherenceCluster=my-cluster`

```
NAME                   READY   STATUS    RESTARTS   AGE
my-cluster-storage-0   1/1     Running   0          2m58s
my-cluster-storage-1   1/1     Running   0          2m58s
my-cluster-storage-2   1/1     Running   0          2m58s
```

The default cluster size is three so there should be three `Pods`

== 3. Scale the Coherence Cluster

=== 3.1 Use kubectl to Scale Up

Using the `kubectl scale` command a specific `CoherenceRole` can be scaled up or down.

```
kubectl -n <namespace> scale coherencerole/storage --replicas=6
```

NOTE: Use the same namespace that the operator was installed into,
e.g. if the namespace is `coherence` the command would be
`kubectl -n coherence scale coherencerole/my-cluster-storage --replicas=6`

=== 3.2 List all of the `Pods` fo the Coherence cluster

```
kubectl -n <namespace> get pod -l coherenceCluster=my-cluster
```

NOTE: Use the same namespace that the operator was installed into,
e.g. if the namespace is `coherence` the command would be
`kubectl -n coherence get pod -l coherenceCluster=my-cluster`

```
NAME                   READY   STATUS    RESTARTS   AGE
my-cluster-storage-0   1/1     Running   0          4m23s
my-cluster-storage-1   1/1     Running   0          4m23s
my-cluster-storage-2   1/1     Running   0          4m23s
my-cluster-storage-3   1/1     Running   0          1m19s
my-cluster-storage-4   1/1     Running   0          1m19s
my-cluster-storage-5   1/1     Running   0          1m19s
```

There should eventually be six running `Pods`.
