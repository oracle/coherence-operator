=== ActionJob



[cols="1,10,1,1"options="header"]
|===
| Field | Description | Type | Required
m| spec | Spec will be used to create a Job, the name is the Coherence deployment name + "-" + the action name The Job will be fire and forget, we do not monitor it in the Operator. We set its owner to be the Coherence resource, so it gets deleted when the Coherence resource is deleted. m| https://{k8s-doc-link}/#jobspec-v1-batch[batchv1.JobSpec] | true
m| labels | Labels are the extra labels to add to the Job. m| map[string]string | false

=== ApplicationSpec

ApplicationSpec is the specification of the application deployed into the Coherence.

[cols="1,10,1,1"options="header"]
|===
| Field | Description | Type | Required
m| type | The application type to execute. This field would be set if using the Coherence Graal image and running a none-Java application. For example if the application was a Node application this field would be set to "node". The default is to run a plain Java application. m| &#42;string | false
m| main | Class is the Coherence container main class.  The default value is com.tangosol.net.DefaultCacheServer. If the application type is non-Java this would be the name of the corresponding language specific runnable, for example if the application type is "node" the main may be a Javascript file. m| &#42;string | false
m| entryPoint | Entrypoint array that will override the "java" entry point configured by the Operator or and any container entry point. This is an advanced use case, specifying an incorrect value here can cause the container not to start. Variable references $(VAR_NAME) are expanded using the container's environment. If a variable cannot be resolved, the reference in the input string will be unchanged. Double $$ are reduced to a single $, which allows for escaping the $(VAR_NAME) syntax: i.e. "$$(VAR_NAME)" will produce the string literal "$(VAR_NAME)". Escaped references will never be expanded, regardless of whether the variable exists or not. Cannot be updated. m| []string | false
m| args | Args is the optional arguments to pass to the main class or the container entry point. m| []string | false
m| workingDir | WorkingDir sets the working directory of the Coherence container. m| &#42;string | false
m| cloudNativeBuildPack | Optional settings that may be configured if using a Cloud Native Buildpack Image. For example an image build with the Spring Boot Maven/Gradle plugin. See: https://github.com/paketo-buildpacks/spring-boot and https://buildpacks.io/ m| &#42;<<CloudNativeBuildPackSpec,CloudNativeBuildPackSpec>> | false
m| springBootFatJar | SpringBootFatJar is the full path name to the Spring Boot fat jar if the application image has been built by just adding a Spring Boot fat jar to the image. If this field is set then the application will be run by executing this jar. For example, if this field is "/app/libs/foo.jar" the command line will be "java -jar app/libs/foo.jar" m| &#42;string | false
m| useImageEntryPoint | UseImageEntryPoint is a flag to indicate that the Coherence container in the Pods should just execute the image entry point and not configure a custom command line. If this flag is set to true any arguments in the Args field are passed as container arguments to the entry point. m| &#42;bool | false
m| useJdkJavaOptions | UseJdkJavaOptions is a flag to indicate that the `JDK_JAVA_OPTIONS` environment variable should be set in the Coherence container to contain the JVM arguments configured by the Operator. Setting `JDK_JAVA_OPTIONS` defaults to true and only applies if UseImageEntryPoint is set to true. m| &#42;bool | false
m| alternateJdkJavaOptions | AlternateJdkJavaOptions specifies an alternative environment variable name to use instead of `JDK_JAVA_OPTIONS` for the command line options. If an application does not want to use the `JDK_JAVA_OPTIONS` environment variable but still wants access to the options the operator would have configured, this field can be set to an environment variable that an application can then access in the container at runtime. The value of the environment variable specified here will be set even if `UseJdkJavaOptions` is set to false. Setting the alternate JVM options environment variable only applies if UseImageEntryPoint is set to true. m| &#42;string | false
|===

=== CloudNativeBuildPackSpec

CloudNativeBuildPackSpec is the configuration when using a Cloud Native Buildpack Image. For example an image build with the Spring Boot Maven/Gradle plugin. See: https://github.com/paketo-buildpacks/spring-boot and https://buildpacks.io/

[cols="1,10,1,1"options="header"]
|===
| Field | Description | Type | Required
m| enabled | Enable or disable buildpack detection. The operator will automatically detect Cloud Native Buildpack images but if this auto-detection fails to work correctly for a specific image then this field can be set to true to signify that the image is a buildpack image or false to signify that it is not a buildpack image. m| &#42;bool | false
m| launcher | &#160; m| &#42;string | false

=== CoherenceJobResourceSpec

CoherenceJobResourceSpec defines the specification of a CoherenceJob resource.

[cols="1,10,1,1"options="header"]
|===
| Field | Description | Type | Required
m| cluster | The name of the Coherence cluster that this CoherenceJob resource belongs to. A CoherenceJob will typically be part of an existing cluster, so this field is required. m| string | false
m| completions | Specifies the desired number of successfully finished pods the job should be run with.  Setting to nil means that the success of any pod signals the success of all pods, and allows parallelism to have any positive value.  Setting to 1 means that parallelism is limited to 1 and the success of that pod signals the success of the job. More info: https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/workloads/controllers/jobs-run-to-completion/ m| &#42;int32 | false
m| syncCompletionsToReplicas | SyncCompletions is a flag to indicate that the Operator should always set the Completions value to be the same as the Replicas value. When a Job is then scaled, the Completions value will also be changed. m| &#42;bool | false
m| podFailurePolicy | Specifies the policy of handling failed pods. In particular, it allows to specify the set of actions and conditions which need to be satisfied to take the associated action. If empty, the default behaviour applies - the counter of failed pods, represented by the job's .status.failed field, is incremented, and it is checked against the backoffLimit. This field cannot be used in combination with restartPolicy=OnFailure. +
 +
This field is alpha-level. To use this field, you must enable the `JobPodFailurePolicy` feature gate (disabled by default). m| &#42;https://{k8s-doc-link}/#podfailurepolicy-v1-batch[batchv1.PodFailurePolicy] | false
m| backoffLimit | Specifies the number of retries before marking this job failed. Defaults to 6 m| &#42;int32 | false
m| ttlSecondsAfterFinished | ttlSecondsAfterFinished limits the lifetime of a Job that has finished execution (either Complete or Failed). If this field is set, ttlSecondsAfterFinished after the Job finishes, it is eligible to be automatically deleted. When the Job is being deleted, its lifecycle guarantees (e.g. finalizers) will be honored. If this field is unset, the Job won't be automatically deleted. If this field is set to zero, the Job becomes eligible to be deleted immediately after it finishes. m| &#42;int32 | false
m| completionMode | CompletionMode specifies how Pod completions are tracked. It can be `NonIndexed` (default) or `Indexed`. +
 +
`NonIndexed` means that the Job is considered complete when there have been .spec.completions successfully completed Pods. Each Pod completion is homologous to each other. +
 +
`Indexed` means that the Pods of a Job get an associated completion index from 0 to (.spec.completions - 1), available in the annotation batch.kubernetes.io/job-completion-index. The Job is considered complete when there is one successfully completed Pod for each index. When value is `Indexed`, .spec.completions must be specified and `.spec.parallelism` must be less than or equal to 10^5. In addition, The Pod name takes the form `$(job-name)-$(index)-$(random-string)`, the Pod hostname takes the form `$(job-name)-$(index)`. +
 +
More completion modes can be added in the future. If the Job controller observes a mode that it doesn't recognize, which is possible during upgrades due to version skew, the controller skips updates for the Job. m| &#42;https://pkg.go.dev/k8s.io/api/batch/v1#CompletionMode | false
m| suspend | Suspend specifies whether the Job controller should create Pods or not. If a Job is created with suspend set to true, no Pods are created by the Job controller. If a Job is suspended after creation (i.e. the flag goes from false to true), the Job controller will delete all active Pods associated with this Job. Users must design their workload to gracefully handle this. Suspending a Job will reset the StartTime field of the Job, effectively resetting the ActiveDeadlineSeconds timer too. Defaults to false. m| &#42;bool | false
m| jobAnnotations | JobAnnotations are free-form yaml that will be added to the Coherence workload's `Job` as annotations. Any annotations should be placed BELOW this "annotations:" key, for example: +
 +
The default behaviour is to copy all annotations from the `Coherence` resource to the `Job`, specifying any annotations in the `JobAnnotations` will override this behaviour and only include the `JobAnnotations`. +
 +
annotations: +
  foo.io/one: "value1" + +
  foo.io/two: "value2" + +
 +
see: https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/overview/working-with-objects/annotations/[Kubernetes Annotations] m| map[string]string | false
m| readyAction | ReadyAction is a probe that will be executed when one or more Pods reach the ready state. The probe will be executed on every Pod that is ready. One the required number of ready Pods is reached the probe will also be executed on every Pod that becomes ready after that time. m| &#42;<<CoherenceJobProbe,CoherenceJobProbe>> | false
m| forceExit | ForceExit is a flag to indicate whether the Operator should call System.exit to forcefully exit the process when the configured main class completes execution. m| &#42;bool | false
m| envFrom | List of sources to populate environment variables in the container. The keys defined within a source must be a C_IDENTIFIER. All invalid keys will be reported as an event when the container is starting. When a key exists in multiple sources, the value associated with the last source will take precedence. Values defined by an Env with a duplicate key will take precedence. Cannot be updated. m| []https://{k8s-doc-link}/#envfromsource-v1-core[corev1.EnvFromSource] | false
m| global | Global contains attributes that will be applied to all resources managed by the Coherence Operator. m| &#42;<<GlobalSpec,GlobalSpec>> | false
m| initResources | InitResources is the optional resource requests and limits for the init-container that the Operator adds to the Pod. +
 ref: https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/configuration/manage-resources-containers/ + +
The Coherence operator does not apply any default resources. m| &#42;https://{k8s-doc-link}/#resourcerequirements-v1-core[corev1.ResourceRequirements] | false

| Field | Description | Type | Required
m| phase | The phase of a Coherence resource is a simple, high-level summary of where the Coherence resource is in its lifecycle. The conditions array, the reason and message fields, and the individual container status arrays contain more detail about the pod's status. There are eight possible phase values: +
 +

m| storageEnabled | A boolean flag indicating whether members of this deployment are storage enabled. This value will set the corresponding coherence.distributed.localstorage System property. If not specified the default value is true. This flag is also used to configure the ScalingPolicy value if a value is not specified. If the StorageEnabled field is not specified or is true the scaling will be safe, if StorageEnabled is set to false scaling will be parallel. +

m| tracing | Tracing is used to configure Coherence distributed tracing functionality. m| &#42;<<CoherenceTracingSpec,CoherenceTracingSpec>> | false
m| allowEndangeredForStatusHA | AllowEndangeredForStatusHA is a list of Coherence partitioned cache service names that are allowed to be in an endangered state when testing for StatusHA. Instances where a StatusHA check is performed include the readiness probe and when scaling a deployment. This field would not typically be used except in cases where a cache service is configured with a backup count greater than zero but it does not matter if caches in those services loose data due to member departure. Normally, such cache services would have a backup count of zero, which would automatically excluded them from the StatusHA check. m| []string | false

see: <<coherence_settings/070_wka.adoc,Well Known Addressing>> m| &#42;<<CoherenceWKASpec,CoherenceWKASpec>> | false
m| skipVersionCheck | Certain features rely on a version check prior to starting the server, e.g. metrics requires >= 12.2.1.4. The version check relies on the ability of the start script to find coherence.jar but if due to how the image has been built this check is failing then setting this flag to true will skip version checking and assume that the latest coherence.jar is being used. m| &#42;bool | false
m| enableIpMonitor | Enables the Coherence IP Monitor feature. The Operator disables the IP Monitor by default. m| &#42;bool | false
m| localPort | LocalPort sets the Coherence unicast port. When manually configuring unicast ports, a single port is specified and the second port is automatically selected. If either of the ports are not available, then the default behavior is to select the next available port. For example, if port 9000 is configured for the first port (port1) and it is not available, then the next available port is automatically selected. The second port (port2) is automatically opened and defaults to the next available port after port1 (port1 + 1 if available). m| &#42;int32 | false
m| localPortAdjust | LocalPortAdjust sets the Coherence unicast port adjust value. To specify a range of unicast ports from which ports are selected, include a port value that represents the upper limit of the port range. m| &#42;https://pkg.go.dev/k8s.io/apimachinery/pkg/util/intstr#IntOrString | false

=== CoherenceStatefulSetResourceSpec

CoherenceStatefulSetResourceSpec defines the specification of a Coherence resource. A Coherence resource is typically one or more Pods that perform the same functionality, for example storage members.

[cols="1,10,1,1"options="header"]
|===
| Field | Description | Type | Required
m| cluster | The optional name of the Coherence cluster that this Coherence resource belongs to. If this value is set the Pods controlled by this Coherence resource will form a cluster with other Pods controlled by Coherence resources with the same cluster name. If not set the Coherence resource's name will be used as the cluster name. m| &#42;string | false
m| statefulSetAnnotations | StatefulSetAnnotations are free-form yaml that will be added to the Coherence cluster `StatefulSet` as annotations. Any annotations should be placed BELOW this "annotations:" key, for example: +
 +
The default behaviour is to copy all annotations from the `Coherence` resource to the `StatefulSet`, specifying any annotations in the `StatefulSetAnnotations` will override this behaviour and only include the `StatefulSetAnnotations`. +
 +
annotations: +
  foo.io/one: "value1" + +
  foo.io/two: "value2" + +
 +
see: https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/overview/working-with-objects/annotations/[Kubernetes Annotations] m| map[string]string | false
m| volumeClaimTemplates | VolumeClaimTemplates defines extra PVC mappings that will be added to the Coherence Pod. The content of this yaml should match the normal k8s volumeClaimTemplates section of a StatefulSet spec as described in https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/storage/persistent-volumes/ Every claim in this list must have at least one matching (by name) volumeMount in one container in the template. A claim in this list takes precedence over any volumes in the template, with the same name. m| []<<PersistentVolumeClaim,PersistentVolumeClaim>> | false
m| scaling | The configuration to control safe scaling. m| &#42;<<ScalingSpec,ScalingSpec>> | false
m| suspendProbe | The configuration of the probe used to signal that services must be suspended before a deployment is stopped. m| &#42;<<Probe,Probe>> | false
m| suspendServicesOnShutdown | A flag controlling whether storage enabled cache services in this deployment will be suspended before the deployment is shutdown or scaled to zero. The action of suspending storage enabled services when the whole deployment is being stopped ensures that cache services with persistence enabled will shut down cleanly without the possibility of Coherence trying to recover and re-balance partitions as Pods are stopped. The default value if not specified is true. m| &#42;bool | false
m| resumeServicesOnStartup | ResumeServicesOnStartup allows the Operator to resume suspended Coherence services when the Coherence container is started. This only applies to storage enabled distributed cache services. This ensures that services that are suspended due to the shutdown of a storage tier, but those services are still running (albeit suspended) in other storage disabled deployments, will be resumed when storage comes back. Note that starting Pods with suspended partitioned cache services may stop the Pod reaching the ready state. The default value if not specified is true. m| &#42;bool | false
m| autoResumeServices | AutoResumeServices is a map of Coherence service names to allow more fine-grained control over which services may be auto-resumed by the operator when a Coherence Pod starts. The key to the map is the name of the Coherence service. This should be the fully qualified name if scoped services are being used in Coherence. The value is a bool, set to `true` to allow the service to be auto-resumed or `false` to not allow the service to be auto-resumed. Adding service names to this list will override any value set in `ResumeServicesOnStartup`, so if the `ResumeServicesOnStartup` field is `false` but there are service names in the `AutoResumeServices`, mapped to `true`, those services will still be resumed. Note that starting Pods with suspended partitioned cache services may stop the Pod reaching the ready state. m| map[string]bool | false
m| suspendServiceTimeout | SuspendServiceTimeout sets the number of seconds to wait for the service suspend call to return (the default is 60 seconds) m| &#42;int | false
m| haBeforeUpdate | Whether to perform a StatusHA test on the cluster before performing an update or deletion. This field can be set to "false" to force through an update even when a Coherence deployment is in an unstable state. The default is true, to always check for StatusHA before updating a Coherence deployment. m| &#42;bool | false
m| allowUnsafeDelete | AllowUnsafeDelete controls whether the Operator will add a finalizer to the Coherence resource so that it can intercept deletion of the resource and initiate a controlled shutdown of the Coherence cluster. The default value is `false`. The primary use for setting this flag to `true` is in CI/CD environments so that cleanup jobs can delete a whole namespace without requiring the Operator to have removed finalizers from any Coherence resources deployed into that namespace. It is not recommended to set this flag to `true` in a production environment, especially when using Coherence persistence features. m| &#42;bool | false
m| actions | Actions to execute once all the Pods are ready after an initial deployment m| []<<Action,Action>> | false
m| envFrom | List of sources to populate environment variables in the container. The keys defined within a source must be a C_IDENTIFIER. All invalid keys will be reported as an event when the container is starting. When a key exists in multiple sources, the value associated with the last source will take precedence. Values defined by an Env with a duplicate key will take precedence. Cannot be updated. m| []https://{k8s-doc-link}/#envfromsource-v1-core[corev1.EnvFromSource] | false
m| global | Global contains attributes that will be applied to all resources managed by the Coherence Operator. m| &#42;<<GlobalSpec,GlobalSpec>> | false
m| initResources | InitResources is the optional resource requests and limits for the init-container that the Operator adds to the Pod. +
 ref: https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/configuration/manage-resources-containers/ + +
The Coherence operator does not apply any default resources. m| &#42;https://{k8s-doc-link}/#resourcerequirements-v1-core[corev1.ResourceRequirements] | false
m| rollingUpdateStrategy | The rolling upgrade strategy to use. If present, the value must be one of "UpgradeByPod", "UpgradeByNode" of "OnDelete". If not set, the default is "UpgradeByPod" UpgradeByPod will perform a rolling upgrade one Pod at a time. UpgradeByNode will update all Pods on a Node at the same time. OnDelete will not automatically apply any updates, Pods must be manually deleted for updates to be applied to the restarted Pod. m| &#42;RollingUpdateStrategyType | false
m| rollingUpdateLabel | The name of the Node label to use to group Pods during a rolling upgrade. This field ony applies if RollingUpdateStrategy is set to NodeLabel. If RollingUpdateStrategy is set to NodeLabel and this field is omitted then the rolling upgrade will be by Node. It is the users responsibility to ensure that Nodes actually have the label used for this field. The label should be one of the node labels used to set the Coherence site or rack value. m| &#42;string | false
m| headlessServiceIpFamilies | HeadlessServiceIpFamilies is the optional array of IP families that can be configured for the headless service used for the StatefulSet. m| []https://pkg.go.dev/k8s.io/api/core/v1#IPFamily | false

=== CoherenceTracingSpec

CoherenceTracingSpec configures Coherence tracing.

[cols="1,10,1,1"options="header"]
|===
| Field | Description | Type | Required
m| ratio | Ratio is the tracing sampling-ratio, which controls the likelihood of a tracing span being collected. For instance, a value of 1.0 will result in all tracing spans being collected, while a value of 0.1 will result in roughly 1 out of every 10 tracing spans being collected. +
 +
A value of 0 indicates that tracing spans should only be collected if they are already in the context of another tracing span.  With such a configuration, Coherence will not initiate tracing on its own, and it is up to the application to start an outer tracing span, from which Coherence will then collect inner tracing spans. +
 +
A value of -1 disables tracing completely. +
 +
The Coherence default is -1 if not overridden. For values other than -1, numbers between 0 and 1 are acceptable. +
 +
NOTE: This field is a k8s resource.Quantity value as CRDs do not support decimal numbers. See https://godoc.org/k8s.io/apimachinery/pkg/api/resource#Quantity for the different formats of number that may be entered. m| &#42;resource.Quantity | false

=== ServiceSpec

ServiceSpec defines the settings for a Service

[cols="1,10,1,1"options="header"]
|===
| Field | Description | Type | Required
m| enabled | Enabled controls whether to create the service yaml or not m| &#42;bool | false
m| name | An optional name to use to override the generated service name. m| &#42;string | false
m| portName | An optional name to use to override the port name. m| &#42;string | false
m| port | The service port value m| &#42;int32 | false
m| type | Kind is the K8s service type (typically ClusterIP or LoadBalancer) The default is "ClusterIP". m| &#42;https://pkg.go.dev/k8s.io/api/core/v1#ServiceType | false
m| externalIPs | externalIPs is a list of IP addresses for which nodes in the cluster will also accept traffic for this service.  These IPs are not managed by Kubernetes.  The user is responsible for ensuring that traffic arrives at a node with this IP.  A common example is external load-balancers that are not part of the Kubernetes system. m| []string | false
m| clusterIP | clusterIP is the IP address of the service and is usually assigned randomly by the master. If an address is specified manually and is not in use by others, it will be allocated to the service; otherwise, creation of the service will fail. This field can not be changed through updates. Valid values are "None", empty string (""), or a valid IP address. "None" can be specified for headless services when proxying is not required. Only applies to types ClusterIP, NodePort, and LoadBalancer. Ignored if type is ExternalName. More info: https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/services-networking/service/#virtual-ips-and-service-proxies m| &#42;string | false
m| clusterIPs | ClusterIPs is a list of IP addresses assigned to this service, and are usually assigned randomly.  If an address is specified manually, is in-range (as per system configuration), and is not in use, it will be allocated to the service; otherwise creation of the service will fail. This field may not be changed through updates unless the type field is also being changed to ExternalName (which requires this field to be empty) or the type field is being changed from ExternalName (in which case this field may optionally be specified, as describe above).  Valid values are "None", empty string (""), or a valid IP address.  Setting this to "None" makes a "headless service" (no virtual IP), which is useful when direct endpoint connections are preferred and proxying is not required.  Only applies to types ClusterIP, NodePort, and LoadBalancer. If this field is specified when creating a Service of type ExternalName, creation will fail. This field will be wiped when updating a Service to type ExternalName.  If this field is not specified, it will be initialized from the clusterIP field.  If this field is specified, clients must ensure that clusterIPs[0] and clusterIP have the same value. +
 +
Unless the "IPv6DualStack" feature gate is enabled, this field is limited to one value, which must be the same as the clusterIP field.  If the feature gate is enabled, this field may hold a maximum of two entries (dual-stack IPs, in either order).  These IPs must correspond to the values of the ipFamilies field. Both clusterIPs and ipFamilies are governed by the ipFamilyPolicy field. More info: https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/services-networking/service/#virtual-ips-and-service-proxies m| []string | false
m| loadBalancerIP | LoadBalancerIP is the IP address of the load balancer Deprecated: This field is deprecated in the Kubernetes API. m| &#42;string | false
m| labels | The extra labels to add to the service. More info: https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/overview/working-with-objects/labels/ m| map[string]string | false
m| annotations | Annotations is free form yaml that will be added to the service annotations m| map[string]string | false
m| sessionAffinity | Supports "ClientIP" and "None". Used to maintain session affinity. Enable client IP based session affinity. Must be ClientIP or None. Defaults to None. More info: https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/services-networking/service/#virtual-ips-and-service-proxies m| &#42;https://pkg.go.dev/k8s.io/api/core/v1#ServiceAffinity | false
m| loadBalancerSourceRanges | If specified and supported by the platform, this will restrict traffic through the cloud-provider load-balancer will be restricted to the specified client IPs. This field will be ignored if the cloud-provider does not support the feature." m| []string | false
m| externalName | externalName is the external reference that kubedns or equivalent will return as a CNAME record for this service. No proxying will be involved. Must be a valid RFC-1123 hostname (https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc1123) and requires Kind to be ExternalName. m| &#42;string | false
m| externalTrafficPolicy | externalTrafficPolicy denotes if this Service desires to route external traffic to node-local or cluster-wide endpoints. "Local" preserves the client source IP and avoids a second hop for LoadBalancer and Nodeport type services, but risks potentially imbalanced traffic spreading. "Cluster" obscures the client source IP and may cause a second hop to another node, but should have good overall load-spreading. m| &#42;https://{k8s-doc-link}/#serviceexternaltrafficpolicy-v1-core[corev1.ServiceExternalTrafficPolicy] | false
m| healthCheckNodePort | healthCheckNodePort specifies the healthcheck nodePort for the service. If not specified, HealthCheckNodePort is created by the service api backend with the allocated nodePort. Will use user-specified nodePort value if specified by the client. Only effects when Kind is set to LoadBalancer and ExternalTrafficPolicy is set to Local. m| &#42;int32 | false
m| publishNotReadyAddresses | publishNotReadyAddresses, when set to true, indicates that DNS implementations must publish the notReadyAddresses of subsets for the Endpoints associated with the Service. The default value is false. The primary use case for setting this field is to use a StatefulSet's Headless Service to propagate SRV records for its Pods without respect to their readiness for purpose of peer discovery. m| &#42;bool | false
m| sessionAffinityConfig | sessionAffinityConfig contains the configurations of session affinity. m| &#42;https://{k8s-doc-link}/#sessionaffinityconfig-v1-core[corev1.SessionAffinityConfig] | false
m| ipFamilies | IPFamilies is a list of IP families (e.g. IPv4, IPv6) assigned to this service, and is gated by the "IPv6DualStack" feature gate.  This field is usually assigned automatically based on cluster configuration and the ipFamilyPolicy field. If this field is specified manually, the requested family is available in the cluster, and ipFamilyPolicy allows it, it will be used; otherwise creation of the service will fail.  This field is conditionally mutable: it allows for adding or removing a secondary IP family, but it does not allow changing the primary IP family of the Service.  Valid values are "IPv4" and "IPv6".  This field only applies to Services of types ClusterIP, NodePort, and LoadBalancer, and does apply to "headless" services.  This field will be wiped when updating a Service to type ExternalName. +
 +
This field may hold a maximum of two entries (dual-stack families, in either order).  These families must correspond to the values of the clusterIPs field, if specified. Both clusterIPs and ipFamilies are governed by the ipFamilyPolicy field. m| []https://pkg.go.dev/k8s.io/api/core/v1#IPFamily | false
m| ipFamilyPolicy | IPFamilyPolicy represents the dual-stack-ness requested or required by this Service, and is gated by the "IPv6DualStack" feature gate.  If there is no value provided, then this field will be set to SingleStack. Services can be "SingleStack" (a single IP family), "PreferDualStack" (two IP families on dual-stack configured clusters or a single IP family on single-stack clusters), or "RequireDualStack" (two IP families on dual-stack configured clusters, otherwise fail). The ipFamilies and clusterIPs fields depend on the value of this field.  This field will be wiped when updating a service to type ExternalName. m| &#42;https://{k8s-doc-link}/#ipfamilypolicy-v1-core[corev1.IPFamilyPolicy] | false
m| allocateLoadBalancerNodePorts | allocateLoadBalancerNodePorts defines if NodePorts will be automatically allocated for services with type LoadBalancer.  Default is "true". It may be set to "false" if the cluster load-balancer does not rely on NodePorts. allocateLoadBalancerNodePorts may only be set for services with type LoadBalancer and will be cleared if the type is changed to any other type. This field is alpha-level and is only honored by servers that enable the ServiceLBNodePortControl feature. m| &#42;bool | false
