                        When stdin is true the stdin stream will remain open across
                        multiple attach sessions. If stdinOnce is set to true, stdin

                            a second hop to another node, but should have good overall

                            is terminated due to an API request or management event
                            such as liveness/startup probe failure, preemption, resource
                            contention, etc. The handler is not called if the container
                            crashes or exits. The reason for termination is passed
                            to the handler. The Pod''s termination grace period countdown
                            begins before the PreStop hooked is executed. Regardless
                            of the outcome of the handler, the container will eventually
                            terminate within the Pod''s termination grace period.
                            Other management of the container blocks until the hook
                            completes or until the termination grace period is reached.
